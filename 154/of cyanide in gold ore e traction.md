## Gold cyanidation
Cyanidation as applied to ordinary gold and silver ores is a relatively simple process.When cyanicides {cyanide consuming elements) are encountered in small amounts in the treatment of such ores,the various schemes already discussed,such as use of a lead salt or wasting barren solution,can usually be resorted to and successful operation maintained.What is the role of cyanide in mining MiningFactsbeen the dominant gold extraction technology since the 1970s,although small scale and artisanal miners continue to use mercury in some areas of the world.[3] In Canada,more than 90% of mined gold is extracted from ore using cyanide.[3] The concentration.

Secondly,the current worldwide concentration of refractory gold ore is becoming the mainstream,the traditional cyanide gold extraction has been unable to cope with the current complex situation,and the emergence of new processes and agents is imminent.How is cyanide used in gold mining?Cyanidation is used to extract gold from a finely ground ore material in a mix with water at about 55% solids by mass.Gold extraction is always a surface processing based extraction process and has nothing to do with the process of Mining itself.
