## Zinc processing
Zinc processing Zinc processing Ores: Zinc ores are widely distributed throughout the world,although more than 40 percent of the world’s output originates in North America and Australia.The common zinc containing minerals are the zinc sulfide known as zinc.Copper Mining and Processing: Processing of Copper Ores …Copper processing is a complicated process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper called cathodes,which will ultimately be made into products for everyday use.The most common types of ore,copper oxide and copper sulfide,undergo two different processes,hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy,respectively,due to the different.

## Enhanced methods for nickel recovery from low grade ores …
Sulfide ore grades range from 0.8% Ni,with 93% of known deposits ranging from 0.2% Ni.All nickel ores have relatively low nickel content,the classification is as follows: high grade nickel ore has Ni content greater than 1.8%,middle grade nickel ore has NiNickel: smelting,producing MetalpediaNickel: smelting Extraction and purification Nickel is recovered through extractive metallurgy: it is extracted from its ores by conventional roasting and reduction processes that yield a metal of greater than 75% purity.In many stainless steel applications,75% pure nickel can be used without further purification,depending on the composition of the impurities.

## Gold extraction
Gold miners excavate an eroded bluff with jets of water at a placer mine in Dutch Flat,California sometime between 18.Gold extraction refers to the processes required to extract gold from its ores.This may require a combination of comminution,mineral processing,hydrometallurgical,and pyrometallurgical processes to be performed on the ore.Sulphide Gold Ore Treatment by Leaching and Flotation …There are many arrangements and combinations using flotation in conjunction with treatment of gold ores.The two gold process flowsheets shown,with some variations,are probably the most commonly used.In Gold Flowsheet No.1 the ore is ground in water to such a size as to free the minerals sufficiently to produce a tailing by flotation low enough in value that it may be discarded.
