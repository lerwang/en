## Processes and Procedures in the Extraction of Iron.
The extraction of iron from its ores is quite a technical process.The iron ore is first roasted in air to produce iron(III) oxide which is mixed with coke and limestone and then further heated to a very high temperature in a blast furnace.These materials are loaded into the blast furnace from the top while a blast of hot air is introduced into it from beneath via small pipes known as tuyeres.IRON AND STEEL1 &ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Types of iron and steel.Cast iron has already been mentioned above.This section deals with the types of iron and steel which are produced as a result of the steel making process.Wrought iron.If all the carbon is removed from the iron to give high purity iron,it is known as wrought iron.Wrought iron is quite soft and easily worked and has.
