## What is the temperature of grinding sparks?
There is a scale called color temperature.The exact temperature from color is called pyrometry.Metal glowing color is exactly the temperature of the surface.White hot is 1200 C,yellow hot is 1000,red hot 650 C.Light bulb filaments are tungst.Grinding machineThe effects of temperature on autogenous grinding can be immediately divided into rheological effects and mechanical effects.The rheological effects are a result of the substantial increase in the viscosity of water as the freezing point is approached.The change in apparent slurry viscosity which results from changing temperature is shown in Figure 1.As can be seen,the effect at high.
