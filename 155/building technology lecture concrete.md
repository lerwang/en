## Introduction to Concrete
CHAPE 1 Introduction to Concrete ConcreteSs versatility,durability,sustainability,and economy have made it the worldSs most widely used construction material.About four tons of concrete are produced per person per year worldwide and about 1.7 tons per.Concrete TechnologyWhy Concrete? Concrete is one of the most versatile,durable,and cost effective building materials known to man Excellent thermal mass energy consumption Concrete is completely non combustible and has a slow rate of heat transfer,making it highly effective against the spread of fire
