## Data types generalization for data mining algorithms.
In this work,the data type fittability problem for six kinds of widely used data mining techniques is discussed and a data type generalization process,including merging and transforming phases is proposed.In the merging phase,the original data types of the data sources to be mined are first merged into the generalized ones.Types of Data Sets in Data Science,Data Mining &amp; Machine …Types of Data Sets for Machine Learning algorithms (classification,regression) → Majority of Data Mining work assumes that data is a collection of records (data objects).→ The most basic form of record data has no explicit relationship among records or data.
