## Fine Aggregate Specific Gravity
Overview The fine aggregate specific gravity test (Figure 1) is used to calculate the specific gravity of a fine aggregate sample by determining the ratio of the weight of a given volume of aggregate to the weight of an equal volume of water.It is similar in nature to the coarse aggregate specific gravity …Standard Test Method for Relative Density (Specific,11 This test method covers the determination of relative density (specific gravity) and the absorption of coarse aggregat The relative density (specific gravity),a dimensionless quantity,is expressed as oven dry (OD),saturated surface dry (SSD),or as apparent relative density (apparent specific gravity)
