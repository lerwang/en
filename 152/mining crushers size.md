## Particle Size Analysis for Mining and Minerals.
Choice of particle size analysis technique is a function of the goals of the analysis.Many of the particles encountered in mining are characterized by sieves (classifiers).These are screens with a known opening (mesh) size.Particles smaller than that mesh size will pass through the screen and larger particles are retained.Crushers28&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Crushers play an important role in the material handling process for underground mine operations.The main purpose of a crusher is the size reduction of the feed.This size reduction is achieved by applying a force to the material,creating cracks in the material which in the end will cause the material to break into smaller pieces.
