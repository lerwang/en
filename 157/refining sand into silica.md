## Process and apparatus for refining sand
A process for refining sand for use as frac sand includes the steps of passing the sand through a first fines separation stage to remove fine particles of contaminant from the sand,reducing the water content of the sand (such as to less than 20%),passing theSilica gel sand for oil …【Character】 The product is white granule,the main component is Silicon dioxide.It can filtering impurities and oxides directly in the oil by filtration,integrating impurity removal,deodorization and separation,making the blackened oil into light transparent liquid.
