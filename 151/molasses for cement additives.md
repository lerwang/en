## Sugarcane molasses Feedipedia
Sugarcane molasses has several important roles in livestock feeding,due to the nutritive,appetizing and physical properties of its sugar content Molasses is difficult to handle because of its viscosity: it is rarely fed directly in its liquid form but instead mixed with other ingredients (Caldwell,2001)Retarders for Concrete Concrete Construction,Premature setting of concrete can have some disastrous effects on profits and job timetabl Flash set might take place with a hot mix on a warm,windy day Floor slabs can set up before finishing is completed,thereby necessitating expensive,time consuming resurfacing or grinding Deep beams.
