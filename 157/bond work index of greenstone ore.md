## Bond Work Index
The Bond work index is not solely a material constant but is influenced by the grinding conditions.For example,the finer the grind size desired,the higher is the kWh t required to grind to that size.Magdalinovic [38] measured the Bond work index of three ore types using different test screen sizes.Bond Work Index Formula EquationBond impact crushability work index (CWi) ( Bond,1963) results reported for iron ores vary from hard iron ore (177 kWh t) to medium hardness iron ore (113 kWh t) and friable iron ore (63 kWh t) ( Table 211; Clout et al,2007 )
