## Effect of Grinding Media on Flotation Chemistry
The flotation behaviors of pyrite and pyrrhotite in a Hallimond tube were correlated with the galvanic role they developed in two and three electrode combinations with mild steel under non abrasive conditions.These correlations substantiated the hypothesis that a coating of iron hydroxides,originating from galvanic interactions,lowered the flotation responses of sulfide minerals.However.Role of silica and alumina content in the flotation of iron …Flotation response of iron ore depends on its impurities.• Silica rich ores float better compared to alumina rich ores.• Clay and gibbsite coat on hematite and hinder flotation.• SEM studies support less coating of quartz due to coarser size.• Silica in the form of
