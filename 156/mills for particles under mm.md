Mineral processing can involve four general types of unit operation:.suitable for separation of particles above 1.7 mm in size; for 1.25 &lt; CC &lt; 1.50,suitable for separation of particles above 6.35 mm in size.In these devices,the particles settle out of the slurry under the effects of gravity,or centripetFrom “Boulder” to Nano ParticlesTo achieve significantly finer materials as the starting point for creating Nano powders,the first two instruments mentioned are no longer suitable.Previously the production of particles under 1 μm with mills from our product range has only been achieved with
