## Beneficiation
1&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;In the mining industry or extractive metallurgy,beneficiation is any process that improves (benefits) the economic value of the ore by removing the gangue minerals,which results in a higher grade product (concentrate) and a waste stream ().There are many different types of beneficiation,with each step furthering the concentration of the original ore.coal beneficiation processCoal Ash Beneficiation and Refining Options.Process for recovering Metals from Coal Ash • The coal ash is heated in a CFBC using coal and the carbon in the ash (LOI) to break the physical bonds of the metals in the ash with the waste heat used for a small T G or used to by pass feedwater heaters in the plant.
