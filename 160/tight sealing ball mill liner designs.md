closely with our customers on improving liner designs.The liner and compound development is under taken to target enhanced availability of the Mill (reducing down time losses) with increased efficiency in grinding,and reduction in power drawn.Trelleborg has a wide range of Rubber lifter bars and plates for Ball Mills,Rod Mills and Drum.Liner Bolts Of Ball MillGrinding Mill Liners Mineral Processing Metallurgy.There are basically two groups of grinding mill liners ones with a high profile and those with a low profile the high profile liner is designed to give the media the higher lift this type will be used in mills that are designed for primary grinding and as a result require the impact of the higher cascade ball mills working as the secondary.

## How to Control the Ball Mill Noise?
The ball mill lays a heat resistant soft rubber mat between the inner surface of the ball mill drum and the liner.To prevent the soft rubber mat from overheating,a 10 15 mm thick industrial felt is placed between the ball mill liner and the soft rubber mat.The ball mill can Reduce the ball mill noise below the allowable standard.Grinding Mill LinersThe wrong liner design will increase power and steel consumption,as well as reduce the grind and throughput of the mill.Liners not only come in different designs,they are available constructed from different materials.Liners may he built from MANGANESE STEEL for rod mills and ball mills that use bigger than two inch balls.

Our ball mill liners are the result of state of the art software driven designs with industry leading inspection data,achieving an optimal charge trajectory and rate of wear life for your ball mill.We ensure your ball mill liners are fitted with precise levels of workmanship,facilitating maximum mill uptime for increased production.Mill ChargeOvercharging results in poor grinding and losses due to abrasion of rods and liners.Undercharging also promotes more abrasion of the rods.The height (or depth) of charge is measured in the same manner as for ball mill.The size of feed particles to a rod mill is coarser than for a ball mill.The usual feed size ranges from 6 to 25 mm.
