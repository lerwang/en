Water inrush from the excavation face often occurs in the current shield construction of metro tunnels.In this study,the discontinuity of shield tunnel lining and the interaction between the tunnel segments,the grouting layer,and the surrounding rock are considered.Based on the 3D nonlinear contact theory,a hybrid model of the shield tunnel is constructed.COMPARISON OF GROUND MOVEMENTS DURINGCOMPARISON OF GROUND MOVEMENTS DURING TRENCHLESS TECHNOLOGY OPERATIONS FOR PIPE AND BOX INSTALLATIONS BY NUMERICAL ANALYSIS Taha Ashoori,Ph.D.E.I.T.The slurry type shield machine,on the other hand,uses the external pressurized slurry to stabilize the cutting face,similar to bored piles or diaphragm walls using bentonite to contain.

## A case study on the stability of the shield excavation.
1.Introduction.With the infrastructure development boom in China,shield tunneling has begun to play an important role in the construction of urban rail networks (Han et al.2018).Ensuring an appropriate face support pressure is a core issue for maintaining the stability of the shield excavation face.7.Directional Drilling and Tunneling Drilling and.Tunneling and drilling operations fall into two broad categories: (1) operations in which excavation is carried out by attacking the rock face selectively,and (2) operations that use a device to advance the whole cross section of the excavation simultaneously.The first category includes all drill and blast and manual methods,and flexible.
