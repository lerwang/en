## Roller versus hammer: Corn particle size impacts.
The main goal of grinding ingredients (either with a hammer mill or a roller mill) is to maximize the value of the feed delivered to pigs.By reducing particle size,corn passing through the digestive tract of the pig will be more effectively exposed to digestive enzymes,and improves the quantity.How the Roller Mills Changed the Milling IndustryThe roller mills increased the amount of flour as well as speed up the milling process.Roller mills could produce more marketable flour than millstone ground operation.The first (gear driven) roller mills used in Washburn &quot;A&quot; Mill,Minneapolis,Minnesota.Roller mills used more belt pulley drives with metal shafting and less large gears.
