## Cyclone Mill Twister
The cyclone mill TWISTER is specially designed for the processing of foods and feeds for subsequent NIR analysis.The optimized form of rotor and grinding chamber generates an air jet which carries the ground sample through the integrated cyclone into the sample bottle.The air jet prevents the material from heating up,thus preserving the moisture content.Feed Processing Flashcards Quizlet1.Cost pellet mills are expensive and feed mills charge $10 to $14 more per ton to run mixed feed through the pellet mill.2.Reduced feed output by the mill.More tons of feed could be manufactures in a day if all feeds were sold as mash rather than pellets.3.Nutrient destruction,although not as extreme as with extruding and expanding.4.
