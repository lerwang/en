## RO Water Chemistry
9&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Calcium (Ca): A divalent cation.Calcium,along with magnesium,is a major component of hardness in brackish water.The solubility of calcium sulfate (CaSO4)(gypsum) is typically limited to 230% with the use of an antiscalant.The solubility of calcium carbonate is typically limited to a LSI (Langlier Saturation Index) value of positive 1.8 to 2.5.Calcium Carbonate Grinding Plant Plants13&ensp;&#0183;&ensp; The majority of nutrients that a plant needs are most available to plants at the aforementioned 5.5 to 6.5 pH range.Adding Magnesium Although it39s not evident in the name calcium carbonate,there is some magnesium Mg in this substance.It is sometimes found with or added to calcium carbonate and is a required element for plants.
