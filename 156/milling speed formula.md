## Drilling Speed and Feed Calculator
Determine the spindle speed (RPM) and feed rate (IPM) for a drilling operation,as well as the cut time for a given cut length.Drilling operations are those in which a cutting tool with sharp teeth,such as a twist drill,rotates and feeds into the workpiece axially.Metric Milling FormulasYou are viewing the milling formulas for metric units,if you'd like to view the milling formulas for english units please click here.Symbol Chart D = Depth of Cut (in millimeters) d = Diameter of Cutter (in millimeters) T = Number of Teeth in Cutter W = Width of Cut K.
