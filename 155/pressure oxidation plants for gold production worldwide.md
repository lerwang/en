## Pressure Oxidation Overview
An overview of the pressure oxidation of refractory gold ores is provided in this chapter.Often there are advantages to be gained by operating at temperatures above the normal boiling point of the solution and,therefore,at pressures above atmospheric.In such cases.Biooxidation BioMineWikiIn this case,a pretreatment stage must be considered,such as pressure oxidation,chemical oxidation,roasting or bio oxidation,the latter currently being the alternative of choice.In the biooxidation process,bacteria partially oxidize the sulfide coating covering the gold microparticles in ores and concentrates.
