## IRON AND FREE RADICAL OXIDATIONS IN CELL …
Brain tissue being rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids,is very susceptible to lipid peroxidation.Iron is well known to be an important initiator of free radical oxidations.We propose that the principal route to iron mediated lipid peroxidations is via iron oxygen complexes rather than the reaction of iron with hydrogen peroxide,the Fenton reaction.How is iron ore beneficiation done? QuoraCase 2: Iron mineral is hematite,gangue minerals are mostly quartz and other silicates,ore liberates at about 1 mm This can be easily separated by hydraulic classification using spiral concentrators,I A fatty acid,particularly oleic acid,can be used to make the hematite surface selectively hydrophobic,and then it can be separated.

## PULSATING HIGH GRADIENT MAGNETIC SEPARATION FOR PURIFICATION OF QUARTZ
Pulsating high gradient magnetic separation for purification of quartz 619 unclear.Therefore,in order to study its feasibility of removal iron from quartz and analyze the separation characterizes,a lab scale PHGMS separator is used for purifying a quartzCHINA’S RARE EARTH ORE DEPOSITS AND BENEFICIATIONacid by saponification was primarily used for rare earth mineral flotation from 1970s and 1980s,then the cyclic alkyl hydroxamic acid synthesized by naphthenic acid was used as collector because the synthesis materials of fatty acids C5 ~ 9 in short supply.
