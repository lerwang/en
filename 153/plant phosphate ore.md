## Uranium from Phosphates Phosphorite Uranium World,
Rock phosphate deposits contain many million tonnes of uranium,which may be extracted as a by product of making fertilisers Some 20,000 tonnes of uranium has already been obtained from these rock phosphate deposits,but the process became uneconomic in the 1990s Higher uranium prices and process refinements have changed the economic situationPhosphate Florida Department of Environmental ProtectionAt the beneficiation plant,the phosphate is separated from the sand and clay The phosphate is sent by rail to a separate chemical processing plant where it is processed for use in fertilizer and other products The chemical processing is done at separate facilities that are,

## Phosphorite Wikipedia
Phosphorite,phosphate rock or rock phosphate is a nondetrital sedimentary rock which contains high amounts of phosphate minerals.The phosphate content of phosphorite (or grade of phosphate rock) varies greatly,from 4% to 20% phosphorus pentoxide (P 2 O 5).Marketed phosphate rock is enriched (&quotbeneficiated&quot) to at least 28%,often more thanCDE preparing to commission phosphate wet processing plant,Expected to be commissioned in the second half of 2019,the start up CDE phosphate washing plant will wash,scrub and de slime free digging ore to produce premium 35% P2O5 and ultra low cadmium phosphate rock concentrate to be used in the manufacture of phosphoric ac It will progress to full scale development in 2021

## How phosphate is mined and processed
phosphorus is often the limiting nutrient; the amount of available phosphorus determines the amount of plant growth and development Where phosphorus is plentiful,plants thrive,and vice versa However,plants cannot absorb limitless amounts of phosphorus Phosphorus not used by plants remains in the soil or runs off in streams and groundwaterFluoride Action Network The Phosphate Fertilizer,In 1997,just two phosphate plants in Louisiana produced 950,000 pounds of commercial uranium,which amounted to roughly 16% of the domestically produced uranium in the US In 1998,the same two plants produced another 950,000 pounds,but due to declining market prices for uranium,both plants have since ceased production
