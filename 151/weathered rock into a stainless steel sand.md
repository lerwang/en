## Composition of the crust
The crust is compositionally distinct outermost rocky layer of the Earth.What is the crust made of? The answer to this question depends on whether we want to know which chemical elements,minerals or rock types it is made of.It may be surprising but about a dozen chemical elements,minerals,or rock types is all that it takes to describe approximately 99% of the crust.The Density of Common Rocks and MineralsThe specific densities of the most common rocks and minerals,with a look at porosity.metals are generally denser than rocks.which is the density of the rock relative to the density of water.On the other end of the spectrum is sandstone,with its large,individual sand grains.Its porosity can reach 10 percent to 35 percent.

Weathering is the breaking down or dissolving of rocks and minerals on Earths surface.Once a rock has been broken down,a process called erosion transports the bits of rock and minerals away.Water,acids,salt,plants,animals,and changes in temperature are all agents of weathering and erosion.All went to work on this ancient mural,eroding.Emissivity Coefficients Materials8&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The emissivity coefficient ε indicates the radiation of heat from a 'grey body' according the Stefan Boltzmann Law,compared with the radiation of heat from a ideal 'black body' with the emissivity coefficient ε = 1.The emissivity coefficient ε for some common materials can be found in the table below.Note that the emissivity coefficients for some products varies with the temperature.
