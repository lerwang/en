## 5.1.Structural Design Calculations
Density of wall construction wall = 23.6 kN m3 Density of base construction base = 23.6 kN m3 Angle of rear face of wall = 90.0 deg Angle of soil surface behind wall = 0.0 deg Effective height at virtual back of wall heff = hwall + lheel tan( ) = 3850 mm.Job Number: 160602 46Design20&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The design process encompasses the architectural design,the development of the structural concept,the analysis of the steel structure and the verification of members.Steel solutions are lighter than their concrete equivalents,with the opportunity to provide more column free flexible floor space,less foundations and a fast,safe construction programme.

## Different Types and Uses of Steel Beams
Not many are aware about the different types and uses of steel beams.Steel beams are extremely crucial and necessary for the construction any building or structure,such as bridges,etc.They come in a wide range of sizes and shapes.Depending on several different factors,the correct ones for your application will be beneficial for your.Design and calculation of the structure of a gantry crane.7&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;translation of the entire structure.Generally the crane moves on rails along the surface to be covered.The operation of a gantry crane is similar to that of a bridge crane with the difference that in the latter the beam supports directly on elevated rails and anchored to the supporting structure of the building where it is located.
