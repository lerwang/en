## Frontiers Calcium—Nutrient and Messenger Plant …
Calcium is an essential element needed for growth and development of plants under both non stressed and stress conditions.It thereby fulfills a dual function,being not only an important factor for cell wall and membrane stability,but also serving as a second messenger in many developmental and physiological processes,including the response of plants to biotic stress.Chemosphere Calcium protects roots of Sedum alfredii H.26&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Calcium shares many physical similarities with Cd and has similar charge and ionic radius at physiological pH values,and antagonism between the two elements has been frequently reported in plants.Cadmium competes with Ca for uptake through ion channels in root cells and guard cells of plants (Clemens et al.1998; White,2000; Perfus Barbeoch et al.2002).
