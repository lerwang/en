## the effect from mining silica sand
Silica exposure is a well known danger for workers in mining and construction.With the spread of frac sand mining,however,silica air pollution has also become a danger for residents near sand mining and processing operations.Children,older adults and people.Silica Sand Mining and HealthAir Monitoring A few years ago,concern mounted surrounding silica sand mining activities and the potential release of large amounts of crystalline silica into the air.In response,MDH developed a health based guidance value for crystalline silica in the air and the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency began conducting air monitoring for crystalline silica near silica sand facilities.

## Sand mining
Sand mining is the extraction of sand,mainly through an open pit but sometimes mined from beaches and inland dunes or dredged from ocean and river beds.Sand is often used in manufacturing,for example as an abrasive or in concrete.It is also used on icy and snowy roads usually mixed with salt,to lower the melting point temperature,on the road surface.Are Solar Panels Good for the Environment? PowerScoutMining silica produces little impact on the environment.According to Minerals Education Coalition,the mining of silica uses standard mining equipment in open pits or dredging.These practices result in minimal environmental impact.
