## How Cement Is Made
The most common way to manufacture portland cement is through a dry method.The first step is to quarry the principal raw materials,mainly limestone,clay,and other materials.After quarrying the rock is crushed.This involves several stages.The first crushingCEMOXICEMOXI For composition analysis of cement and raw materials The success of any application is dependent on the quality of the calibration standards used.Finding high quality standards in the required analytical range is not only challenging but in most cases.
