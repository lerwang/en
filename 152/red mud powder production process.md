## Application of Bayer red mud for iron recovery and building material.
8 Apr 2008.Red mud is a solid waste produced in the process of alumina extraction from bauxite.In this paper.The optimum reaction parameters were proposed as the following: ratio of carbon powder: red mud at 18:100,ratio of additives: red mud at 6:100,roasting at 1300 degrees C for 110min.With these optimum&nbsp;.Iron oxide red production processIron oxide in iron oxide red,iron oxide green,iron oxide brown,yellow iron oxide and other colors of dyeing materials to meet the requirements of different colors.Iron oxide red is the largest use of iron oxide,it is a red powder,the scientific name of iron oxide,the following describes Iron oxide red production process.

## How aluminium is produced
The next stage in the production chain is the processing of bauxite into alumina,or aluminium oxide Al 2 O 3, a white powder.The most common process for making alumina from bauxite is the Bayer process,which was first discovered over 100 years ago but is still in wide use today.Current Status of an Industrial Waste: Red Mud an. IJLTEMASsteps.In the first step alumina is produced by wet chemical,caustic leach method (Bayer process).In the second step aluminium is produced from alumina by Hall Heroult process.approximately 90 million tonnes of red mud being produced every year [75].powder.This powder is technical purity alumina,containing.

The normal production route taken is to refine the bauxite to aluminium oxide,or alumina [Al2O3],which is a white,crystalline powder.This powder is then smelted to form.Given the composition of bauxite,for every tonne of alumina produced there is approximately another tonne of red mud.Naturally,there is a certain&nbsp;.DEVELOPMENT OF FIBRE CEMENT USING ADDITIVE RED …23&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Red mud (RM) is a wasted product during the Alumina production using Bayer process.The red mud has caused to severe environmental problem in many industry countries.The chemical and phase composition of RM varies and depend on the source of bauxite as well as the parameter of process operated.
