Kaolin also called as China Clay is nearly white in colour.It is distinguished from other industrial clays based on its fine particle size and pure colourings.Its ability to disperse in water makes it an ideal pigment.The primary constituent in kaolin is the mineral.Kaolinite (Kaolin)Kaolin is a hydrated aluminium silicate,a clay material which is crystallised.The structure repeats itself in each individual layer and therefore the plasticity is low,but the stability is enormous.Kaolin is characterised by a small particle size and an extremely high
