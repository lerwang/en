## Honing (metalworking) Wikipedia
Honing is an abrasive machining process that produces a precision surface on a metal workpiece by scrubbing an abrasive stone against it along a controlled path Honing is primarily used to improve the geometric form of a surface,but may also improve the surface texture Typical applications are the finishing of cylinders for internal combustion engines,air bearing spindles and gearsElectrochemical Grinding: Working,Application,Advantages,29 08 2019&#0183;&#32;In Electrochemical grinding,the metal bonded grinding wheel filled with a non conductive abrasive The grinding wheel act as a cathode and the workpiece is act as an anode The electrolyte,which is usually sodium nitrate,sodium chloride,potassium nitrite,with a concentration of 0150 to 0300 kg litre of water
