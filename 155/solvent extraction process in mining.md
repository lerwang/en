## Solvent extraction and electrowinning Wikipedia
Solvent extraction and electrowinning (SX EW) is a two stage hydrometallurgical process that first extracts and upgrades copper ions from low grade leach solutions into a solvent containing a chemical that selectively reacts with and binds the copper in the solvent.Innovations: Introduction to Copper: Mining & ExtractionIntroduction to Copper: Mining & Extraction Copper Applications in Metallurgy of Copper & Copper Alloys.The process yields concentrates containing roughly.Today,more than 13% of all "new" copper is produced from leachates,which are normally concentrated using solvent extraction (SX) and stripped of their copper content by conventional.
