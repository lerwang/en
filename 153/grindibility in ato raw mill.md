The grindability of the fuel directly impacts the overall efﬁciency of the combustion process and as such it is an important parameter.In the present study,the grindability of different torreﬁed biomass pellets was tested in three different laboratory mill typesMILLSmill drum (Tmin,Tmax,Pmin,Pmax) are adjusted for each mill type and specific dust preparation system individually.The task of the main operation mode of the controller optimizer is to ensure such a feeding of raw coal into the mill at which the maximum possible grinding capacity is reached.The

## Hardgrove Grindability Index
Hardgrove Grindability Index (short HGI) is a measure for the grindability of coal.Grindability is an index,therefore it has no unit.The smaller the HGI,the harder is coal texture and less grindable is the coal.Grindability is an important factor for the design a coal mill.Improvements in New4 o Cement manufacture consumes typically 3,100 3,400 MJ of fuel t clinker &amp; 90 kWh t cement in a modern plant,&amp; more for older or less efficient plants; o Generally 2 3 of the electricity consumed is used in the grinding of raw materials,fuels &amp; finished

## Simulation studies on Energy Requirement,Work Input and.
Grindability is the number of net grams of screen undersized product per revolution (Perry and Chilton,1973).The main purpose of study of the grindability is to evaluate the size and type of mill needed to produce a speBond Grindability Test ProcedureThe Bond Ball Mill Grindability test is designed to give a measure of the grinding characteristics of a material by finding the amount of size reduction resulting from a controlled energy input.Ball Mill Grindability of a material depends upon its hardness,structure,the manner in which it is fractured.The grindability is useful in evaluating power requirements for grinding.
