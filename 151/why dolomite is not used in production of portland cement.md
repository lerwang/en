## Manufacture of Portland Cement
17&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Hydration of Portland Cement.Introduction Portland cement is a hydraulic cement,hence it derives its strength from chemical reactions between the cement and water.The process is known as hydration.Cement consists of the following major compounds (see composition of cement): Tricalcium silicate,C 3 S; Dicalcium silicate,C 2 S; Tricalcium.How Cement Is MadePortland cement is the basic ingredient of concrete.Concrete is formed when portland cement creates a paste with water that binds with sand and rock to harden.Cement is manufactured through a closely controlled chemical combination of calcium,silicon,aluminum,iron and other ingredients.Common materials used to manufacture cement include.
