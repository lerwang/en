## Aluminum processing Ores Britannica
Aluminum processing Aluminum processing Ores: Aluminum is the third most abundant element on Earth's surface.Only oxygen and silicon are more common.Earth's crust to a depth of 16 km (10 miles) contains 8 percent aluminum.Aluminum has a strong tendency to combine with other common elements and so rarely occurs in nature in the metallic form.Aluminium Geoscience Australia202055&ensp&#0183&enspFurther resource and production information.Mining.Extraction of aluminium metal takes place in three main stages&#191mining of bauxite ore,refining the ore to recover alumina and smelting alumina to produce aluminium.Bauxite is mined by surface methods (opencut mining) in which the topsoil and overburden are removed by bulldozers and scrapers.
