## CONCRETE TECHNOLOGY Diagnosis and Control of Alkali Aggregate Reactions in Concrete
Alkali Silica Reaction MECHANISM OF ASR Concrete consists of aggregates—stone or gravel and sand,in a matrix of cement paste.The cement paste contains interconnected microscopic pores through which water or ions in solution can migrate.The pore†High Performance Concrete Using Fumed SilicaHigh fineness,uniformity,high pozzolanic activity and compatibility with other ingredients are of primary importance in selection of mineral admixture as per ACI 363R 5.As per the Table Silica fume has the maximum fineness of 28 m 2 g whereas the fumed Silica has the fineness of 190 m 2 g which is 6 to 7 times finer than Silica fume.

## How Does Silica Fume Work in Concrete?
When silica fume is added to concrete,initially it remains inert Once portland cement and water in the mix start reacting with each other (hydrating),primary chemical reactions produce two chemical compounds: Calcium Silicate Hydrate (CSH),which is the strength producing crystallization,and Calcium Hydroxide (CH),a by product also called free,High Density Concrete Using Fly Ash,Micro Silica,High Density Concrete Using Fly Ash,Micro Silica and Recycled Aggregate An,cement by Fly ash and Micro silica with 0%,5%,10% and,Keywords: fly ash,micro silica,recycled concrete aggregate,partial replacement 1 Introduction
