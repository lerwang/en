## Direct reduction metallurgy Britannica
In iron processing: Direct reduction (DR) This is any process in which iron is extracted from ore at a temperature below the melting points of the materials involved Gangue remains in the spongelike product,known as direct reduced iron,or DRI,and must be removed in a subsequent steelmaking,Is pig iron and sponge iron the same or not? QuoraMar 07,2019&#0183;&#32;No They aren’t The source of both pig iron and sponge iron are iron ore In case of pig iron,the ore is reduced and melt in the blast furnace and the preliminary product is liquid iron,which solidifies to pig iron On the other hand,sponge ir.

DRI production; Direct reduction of iron is the removal of oxygen from iron ore or other iron bearing materials in the solid state,ie without melting,as in the blast furnace The reducing agents are carbon monoxide and hydrogen,coming from reformed natural gas,syngas or coal(PDF) Coating of iron oxide pellets for direct reductionDepending upon their chemical composition and,to a lesser extent,on their physical properties,iron oxide pellets exhibit varying degrees of sticking tendency during direct reduction at elevated.

## Direct Reduced Iron
7&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Direct reduced iron is a metallic material formed by the reduction (removal of oxygen) of iron oxide (iron ore) at temperatures below the melting point of iron.DRI is produced by the use of a reducing gas (mostly a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide).
