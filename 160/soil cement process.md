## Cement Stabilisation
Plastic Soil Cement: A hardened or semihardened intimate mixture of pulverized soil,Portland cement,and water,where the soil and cement is mixed at a high water content such that the material can be pumped.This mixture is often placed without compaction and is best suited for most soils except for clayey or organic soils.TLT 501 (02) MIX DESIGN METHOD FOR SOIL CEMENT …2015 12 15&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;2.14 TLT 503 Wet dry test for soil cement mixtures 2.15 TLT 504 Freeze thaw test for soil cement mixtures 2.16 TLT 649 Water analysis 3.0 OUTLINE OF METHOD 3.1 The procedures for the Soil Cement design starts with the selection and preparation of the aggregate and test specimens.Preliminary to the operation it is required that:

## Ettringite formation in soil cement interaction process.
Ettringite is known as one of the important minerals which forms in the process of cement hydration.Sulfate resistance cement can be used to prevent the ettringite formation due to excluding alumina ions in its production process.However,clayey soils might contribute to the formation of ettringite due to the solubility of alumina ions at.SOIL CEMENT2018 2 23&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Soil cement shall consist of soil,portland cement,and water proportioned,mixed,placed,compacted,and cured in accordance with these specifications; and shall conform to the lines,grades,thicknesses,and typical cross sections shown in the plans.These suggested specifications cover construction of soil cement
