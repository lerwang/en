## Iron processing
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Iron making The primary objective of iron making is to release iron from chemical combination with oxygen,and,since the blast furnace is much the most efficient process,it receives the most attention here.Alternative methods known as direct reduction are used in over a score of countries,but less than 5 percent of iron is made this way.How to Produce Steel Plates? The Steel Plates,Jan 01,2019&#0183;&#32;The Steel Plates Manufacturing Process,Primary Steel Making Steelmaking starts with melting the raw inputs of iron ore,coke (produced by carbonisation of coking coal) and limestone together in a blast furnace The resulting red hot molten iron contains 4 45% carbon and other impurities that make it brittle
