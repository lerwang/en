## Fly ash
22&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Fly ash often replaces up to 30% by mass of Portland cement,but can be used in higher dosages in certain applications.In some cases,fly ash can add to the concrete's final strength and increase its chemical resistance and durability.Fly ash can significantly improve the workability of concrete.Effects of Carbon on Air Entrainment in Fly Ash …25&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The most important commercial outlet for coal ash is in the concrete industry as a partial replacement for Portland cement.In many concrete mixtures careful control of air entrainment is required,but the presence of solid carbon disrupts the air entrainment process.An earlier study focused on the fundamental role of carbons,which were found to adsorb air entraining admixtures,the.

## Why use Fly Ash and Slag in Concrete?
Although set times are prolonged with fly ash,in just 28 days,the strength of the concrete will surpass the same mix without the fly ash.Slag is similar to fly ash in that it is finer than standard Portland cement and is also cheaper as it is a process byproduct.Slag is produced by the steel production industry.HuberCrete Calcium Carbonate as a Partial Replacement …20&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;result is less production of acceptable grades of fly ash for concrete producers.Other materials can replace fly ash in concrete.The most notable material is blast furnace slag.It is cementitious and pozzolanic,thus,an excellent replacement for fly ash.It suffers from a somewhat limited supply situation also,and usually at an increased cost.
