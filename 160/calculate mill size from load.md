## Mill (grinding)
A mill is a device that breaks solid materials into smaller pieces by grinding,crushing,or cutting.Such comminution is an important unit operation in many processes.There are many different types of mills and many types of materials processed in them.Historically mills were powered by hand (e.g.via a hand crank),working animal (e.g.hLoad Analysis and Driven Power Calculation …28&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Calculation of driving power 3.1 Lower roller drive moment.The lower roller of the plate rolling machine is the driving roller,and the driving torque on the lower roller is used to overcome the deformation torque T n1 and the friction torque T n2.In the process of steel plate rolling,the deformation capabilities which stored in AB section of steel plate (see Fig 1a and Fig 2) is 2Mθ,the.
