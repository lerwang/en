## Mix Design and Pumped Concrete
The shape of the coarse aggregate,whether crushed or uncrushed has an influence on the mix proportions,although both shapes can be pumped satisfactorily.The crushed pieces have a larger surface area per unit volume as compared to uncrushed pieces and thus require relatively more mortar to coat the surface.Aggregates size for m25Aggregates size for m25 Products As a leading global manufacturer of crushing,grinding and mining equipments,we offer advanced,reasonable solutions for any size reduction requirements including,Aggregates size for m25,quarry,aggregate,and different kinds.

For example,for a grade of concrete with a strength of 20 MPa,it would be denoted by M20,where M stands for Mix and 20 is the overall strength of the concrete in Newton Major ingredients of concrete are binding material (like cement,lime),fine aggregate (sand),Mix design of concrete for Grade M35,M30,M25,and M20,Coarse Aggregate (Kg m3 ) = 10822 (60% of 20 mm,40% of 10 mm) Admixture (Kg m3 ) = 4848 Water Cement Ratio (Kg m3 ) = 045 In the same way,we can calculate the Mix design proportion of M30 concrete,Mix design procedure for M25 grade of,
