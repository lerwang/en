## Slaked lime SMA Mineral
How it’s produced: Mixing quicklime and water releases energy in the form of heat and forms slaked lime.Depending on how much water is added during the process,slaked lime is either formed as a dry powder or a paste.Uses: Uses of slaked lime include waterCalcium carbonateWater can be added to lime to form calcium hydroxide.The process is known as 'slaking'.Solid calcium hydroxide is known as slaked lime or hydrated lime,and solutions and suspensions in water as milk of lime.The term lime is often used to cover quicklime

## Calcium hydroxide
Calcium hydroxide (traditionally called slaked lime) is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula Ca() 2.It is a colorless crystal or white powder and is produced when quicklime (calcium oxide) is mixed,or slaked with water.It has many names including hydrated lime,caustic lime,builders' lime,slack lime,cal,or pickling lime.Lime in Soil Stabilization GraymontSoil stabilization occurs when the proper amount of lime is added to a reactive soil.Stabilization differs from modification in that a significant increase in strength is developed over the longer term through an on going pozzolanic reaction.
