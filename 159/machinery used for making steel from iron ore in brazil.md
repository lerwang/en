## What Are the Main Uses of Iron Ore? Reference.com
Iron ore is the main ingredient in steel,which makes up 95 percent of the metals used in the world per year.Two billion metric tons of raw iron ore are produced in a year.The world's largest single producer of iron ore is Brazilian mining company Vale,which produces over 350 million tons of iron ore annually.Fall in China demand leads Australia to predict iron ore …Brazil based Vale is planning to lift iron ore exports 7 percent in 2018 to 390 million tonnes.In Australia,Rio Tinto and BHP,along withFortescue Metals Group aim to add about 170 million.
