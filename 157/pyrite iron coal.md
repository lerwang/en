## Pyrite
An abundant mineral in nature and despite its potential as raw material for different segments of industry,when it comes from coal mining,pyrite (FeS 2) is treated as waste,and its disposal culminates in environmental problems for the coalfields.Increasing the purity of pyritic tailings,increasing its iron disulfide content,strengthen the possibility of turning it into a value added by.Role of pyrite in formation of hydroxyl radicals in coal.The harmful effects from inhalation of coal dust are well documented.The prevalence of lung disease varies by mining region and may,in part,be related to regional differences in the bioavailable iron content of the coal.Pyrite (FeS2),a common inorganic component in coal,has been shown to spontaneously form reactive oxygen species (ROS) (i.e.hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals) and.

## Iron Pyrite: Meanings,Properties,and Benefits
The term came from the Greek term pyros or pyr’or that means fire.The iron pyrite may create sparks when it is struck against metal or a stone.The make up of the iron pyrite is the iron disulfide,and it has already been found in a huge number of localities all over the world and is frequently found in various coal …SO2 Removal by Leaching Coal Pyrite Energy &amp; Fuels26&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The removal of SO2 was accomplished by the catalysis of iron that was produced by leaching of coal pyrite with combination of SO2 and O2.This leaching reaction was found to be controlled by a chemical reaction with an apparent activation energy of 11.6 kcal mol.SO2 removal increased with increasing O2 concentration up to 10% and leveled off.
