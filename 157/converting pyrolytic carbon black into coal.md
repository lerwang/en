## How to Convert Carbon Monoxide to Oxygen Sciencing
The combustion products of hydrocarbons,particularly fossil fuels,are carbon monoxide,carbon dioxide and water.Green plans convert the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere back into oxygen using chlorophyll in their leaves.This cycle keeps the oxygen level in air at a constant and acceptable level.Carbon monoxide.Converting CO2 Back to FuelThere have been a number of attempts over the past decades to use solar energy to reduce carbon dioxide (CO 2) and water (H 2 O) into a variety of products,including hydrogen and carbon monoxide for use as a syngas for further processing (e.g.Fischer Tropsch) as well as direct hydrocarbon products.
