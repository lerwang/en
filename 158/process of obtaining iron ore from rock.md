## Gold extraction
Gold extraction refers to the processes required to extract gold from its ores.This may require a combination of comminution,mineral processing,hydrometallurgical,and pyrometallurgical processes to be performed on the ore.[1] Gold mining from alluvium ores was once achieved by techniques associated with placer mining such as simple gold.ProcessesProcesses Copper is found in natural ore deposits around the world.This page explains the production route taken from extraction of ore containing rock to a final product that is the highest purity commercial metal in existence and used in a wide variety of

## Copper Mining and Processing: Processing of Copper …
Copper processing is a complicated process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper called cathodes,which will ultimately be made into products for everyday use.The most common types of ore,copper oxide and copper sulfide,undergo two different processes,hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy,respectively,due to the different.Iron Ore Processing for the Blast FurnaceMining Iron Ore Mining iron ore begins at ground level.Taconite is identified by diamond drilling core samples on a grid hundreds of feet into the earth.Taconite rock comprises about 28 percent iron; the rest is sand or silica.These samples are analyzed and
