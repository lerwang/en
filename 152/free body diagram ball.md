## 5.8: Drawing Free Body Diagrams
The first step in describing and analyzing most phenomena in physics involves the careful drawing of a free body diagram.Free body diagrams have been used in examples throughout this chapter.Remember that a free body diagram must only include the external forces acting on the body of interest.Coulomb's Law31&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;the pit ball and the distance between the balls.Fig.1 below demonstrates the setup and the free body diagram for the force analysis.Fig.1 On the left is the schematics of the experimental setup.The strings should join at the origin of a protractor so that the angle q can be easily measured.
