## Hydroxyapatite Synthesized from Waste Eggshell via Ball.
Hydroxyapatite was synthesized using calcium originated from waste eggshell that was reacted with phosphate obtHydroxyapatite synthesized from oyster shell powders by.The ratio of oyster shell powders to calcium pyrophosphate was 4:3 (mole ratio),i.e.the stoichiometric Ca P content in the composition of hydroxyapatite (Ca P = 1.67).They were then wet milled in a planetary ball milling machine (QM 3SP4J,Nangjing,China) for 1,5,or 8 h at a rotating speed of 170 rpm in a zirconia bottle.
