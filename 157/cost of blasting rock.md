## Optimization of Blasting Parameters in Underground Stope.
Many problems existed in pyrite mine including large consumption of blasting materials,high boulder yield and low production capacity.According to the effect of blasting parameters,different drilling parameters were selected to perform the industrial tests in stopes.At.How Much Does Rock Excavation Cost? …4&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;How much does rock excavation cost? Depending on the type of rock,the size of the job,placement,contractor rates,the equipment being used,and geographical location,most rock excavation jobs will cost $5 to $35 per cubic yard if a blasting method is used,but this price could be much higher if it were a public bid job.Because all jobs will be so unique,highly consider a free quote.
