evolution of mechanical milling process of a MmNi 5 Ni mixture obtained from Mm and Ni powders using a low energy mill was published previously [7].In this work,the temporal evolution of the milling process of a MmNi 5 Ni mixture is presented.Initial mixture is obtained by a combination of mechanical milling with low heating temperature [7].Structure and magnetic properties of SmxCo5 α Fe (x=0.65 1.Powder mixtures of SmxCo5 (x=0.65 1.3)+20 wt % α Fe were mechanically milled.Annealing these as milled powders results in the formation of a mixture of the hard phase Sm (Co,Fe) and the soft phase Fe Co.For the as milled Sm1Co5+20 wt % α Fe powder,the hard phase changes with the increase of annealing temperatures.The optimal maximum energy product (BH)max is obtained in the powder.
