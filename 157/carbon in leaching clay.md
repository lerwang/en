## Leaching (agriculture)
In agriculture,leaching is the loss of water soluble plant nutrients from the soil,due to rain and irrigation.Soil structure,crop planting,type and application rates of fertilizers,and other factors are taken into account to avoid excessive nutrient loss.Leaching may also refer to the practice of applying a small amount of excess.(PDF) Leaching of organic carbon from grassland soils.Leaching of organic carbon from grassland soils under anaerobiosis.Article (PDF Available).but lower clay contents in the top than subsoil (p &lt; 0.05).Fe con tents varied and 344.
