## Structural Applications of 100 Percent Fly Ash Concrete
1&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;KEYWORDS: fly ash,fly ash concrete.INTRODUCTION.Over the past four years,significant research has been done at Montana State University (MSU) on fly ash concrete for structural applications.The material being investigated is a conventional concrete mixture in which the Portland cement has been replaced by Class C fly ash for the binder.FLY ASH CONCRETEChemically,fly ash is a pozzolan.When mixed with lime (calcium hydroxide),pozzolans combine to form cementitious compounds.Fly ash in concrete contributes to a stronger,more durable,and more chemical resistant concrete mix.The main benefit of fly ash for concrete is that it not only reduces the amount of non durable calcium hydroxide.

Fly ash is the residual material left over from coal burning power plants.The physical and chemical properties of fly ash are pozzolanic,meaning it reacts and hardens in the presence of water.When mixed with lime (calcium hydroxide),pozzolans combine to form cementitious compounds.Demand for fly ash increased ready mix set to increase.25&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The American Coal Ash Association’s recent findings on utilization of coal combustion products shows that demand for ready mixed concrete is a primary driver for fly ash utilization.The American Coal Ash Association report stated,“The utilization rate of fly ash has grown from 8.4 percent of production in 1974 to 43.7 percent in 2013.

## Coal Fly Ash
Fly ash,especially Class F fly ash,is effective in three ways in substantially reducing alkali silica expansion: 1) it produces a denser,less permeable concrete; 2) when used as a cement replacement it reduces total alkali content by reducing the Portland cement; and 3) alkalis react with fly ash instead of reactive silica aggregates.Fresh properties (Workability for normal concrete) Pre lab.16&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;a slump cone b.a compacting rod c.a ruler d.all of the above Question 6 Q 22 (1 point) In a normal concrete mix and assuming all other variables are kept constant,a lower replacement ratio of cement by fly ash would make the fresh concrete Student response
