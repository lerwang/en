## Direct reduced iron
Direct reduced iron (DRI),also called sponge iron,[1] is produced from the direct reduction of iron ore (in the form of lumps,pellets,or fines) to iron by a reducing gas or elemental carbon produced from natural gas or coal.Many ores are suitable for direct reduction.Direct reduction refers to solid state processes which reduce iron.Iron oreIn 2017 Canadian iron ore mines produced 49 million tons of iron ore in concentrate pellets and 13.6 million tons of crude steel.Of the 13.6 million tons of steel 7 million was exported,and 43.1 million tons of iron ore was exported at a value of $4.6 billion.

## What is Direct Reduced Iron? (with picture)
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Direct reduced iron (DRI) is a type of alternative iron made by heating iron ore so that the oxygen and carbon burns off while the temperature is kept below iron's melting point.Direct reduced iron is also known as sponge iron and is sold as briquettes,lumps,or pellets.PelletsThe main advantage of pellets over sintering iron ore is that they can be more easily transported over long distances.All forms of transport can be used,provided that pellets are not contaminated or mixed with any other materials,and excluding cargo spillage.
