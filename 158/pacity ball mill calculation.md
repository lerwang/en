## Ball mill
A ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind,blend and sometimes for mixing of materials for use in mineral dressing processes,paints,pyrotechnics,ceramics and selective laser sintering.It works on the principle of impact and attrition: size reduction is done by impact as the balls drop from near the top of the shell.A ball mill.How to Size a Ball Mill Design Calculator &amp; FormulaA) Total Apparent Volumetric Charge Filling including balls and excess slurry on top of the ball charge,plus the interstitial voids in between the balls expressed as a percentage of the net internal mill volume (inside liners).B) Overflow Discharge Mills operating at low ball fillings slurry may accumulate on top of the ball charge; causing,the Total Charge Filling Level to be.
