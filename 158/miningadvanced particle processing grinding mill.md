## Fine Refining Ball Mill
The principles of grinding are well established: the pre ground liquor is pumped through the ball mill’s grinding vessel in one or more stages.The refining action is accomplished by a special shaft with agitator arms and diverters rotating in a vertical jacketed grinding tank,which is filled with hardened steel balls.Mineral Comminution fine ultrafine grindingComminution.Grinding Solutions offers an extensive range of comminution services,ranging from SAG mill testing to fine and ultrafine grinding.Tests range from industry standards,such as Bond Work Index Testing,to cutting edge techniques such as pulp chemistry monitoring,to help optimise comminution circuits.

## Dry Grinding VS Wet Grinding
Dry Grinding VS Wet Grinding.to drive a tube mill in which a given material is being wet ground may be as much as 30 % less than that of a similar mill dry grinding.Furthermore the throughput of a continuous feed mill is greater in wet grinding; probably due to the better flow properties of a pulp in comparison with a dry material.Ultra Fine GrindingUltra Fine Grinding UFG mills overcome these limitations by the use of rotating stirrers inside a stationary mill shell.Ultra fine grinding mills have been in use for many years in a large number of every day applications such as pharmaceuticals,dyes,clays,paint and pigments before being used in
