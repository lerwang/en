## Extraction Process of Aluminium from Bauxite Ore
Aluminum is extracted from bauxite ore by way of the Bayer process This requires a great deal of electricity; consequently,a large amount of aluminum is processed in Iceland,which gets its electricity through geothermal energy To extract aluminum,the bauxite ore is first crushed,then mixed with lime,hot water and soda ashMaking Vanadium VanitecMore than 95% of global Reserves are in China,Russia,South Africa and Australia Titaniferous magnetite is the most important source for vanadium presently accounting about 85% of the current world V2O5 production This iron ore typically contains 10% to 15% V2O5

The basic extraction of ore deposits follows these steps: Prospecting or exploration to find and then define the extent and value of ore where it is located ("ore body") Conduct resource estimation to mathematically estimate the size and grade of the deposit; Conduct a pre feasibility study to determine the theoretical economics of the ore depositAluminium MarketIn 2014 global aluminium production have reached 54 mln tonn The ex China aluminium market was in shortfall of 12 million tonn According to CRU and International Aluminium Institute in the first half of 2015 aluminium production in the world outside ex China grew by 2% YoY to 13 million tonn
