## Rod mills,how they function
Wet grinding rod mills are normally used in the mineral processing industry.Dry grinding is used in some areas; however,it is confronted with problems and should be avoided except where absolutely necessary.Rod mills operate at lower speed than ball mills since the rods are rolled and not cascaded.AG millsAG mills can accomplish the same size reduction work as two or three stages of crushing and screening,a rod mill and some or all of the work done by a ball mill.AG mills are also an optimum solution for wet grinding since crushing and screening in these cases can be difficult,if not impossible.
