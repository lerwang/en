## Steps in the Modern Steelmaking Process
Ironmaking,the first step in making steel,involves the raw inputs of iron ore,coke,and lime being melted in a blast furnace.The resulting molten iron—also referred to as hot metal—still contains 4.5% carbon and other impurities that make it brittle.SinteringSintering or frittage is the process of compacting and forming a solid mass of material by heat or pressure without melting it to the point of liquefaction.Sintering happens naturally in mineral deposits or as a manufacturing process used with metals,ceramics,plastics,and …
