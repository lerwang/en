## Density of Aggregate
Density is an important parameter for aggregate.For aggregates,density is determined by multiplying the relative density (specific gravity) of the aggregate times the density of water.Bulk Density of Aggregate [1]The bulk density or unit weight of an aggregate is the mass or weight of the aggregate that required to fill a container of a specified unit volume.Classification of AggregatesClassification of Aggregates The variability in density can be used to produce concrete of widely different unit weights,see Table (1).The most common classification of aggregates on the basis of bulk specific gravity is lightweight,normal weight,and heavyweight.
