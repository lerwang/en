## How do I estimate the quantity of rebar in slab?
Method 1: You can make a rough estimate by using thumb rule that about 80 kg of rebar is required per cum.of slab.So if slab size is say 10m x 10m x 0.2m.Concrete = 10 x 10 x 0.2 = 20 cum.Therefore,Rebar = 80 kg x 20 = 1600 kg = 1.6 MT Method.Rebar US Imperial Reinforcing BarConcrete Columns Estimate concrete volume required for concrete,Round Bar Round bar weights; Rebar Metric Reinforcing Bar Reinforcing bar European metric dimensions ; Rebar Weights Weights of rebar rods size ranging 1 4; Tag Search en: reinforcing bar re bar steel us imperial,Add standard and customized parametric.

## How many kg of 16mm rebar per m3 of concrete? Bayt,
Normally Rough estimate can be done by considering following 1) % of steel volume in fiundation concrete = 1 to 3 % 2) % of steel volume in column concrete = 2 to 5 %,Lets consider you have column and 3% of steel in column concrete Desnity of steel rebar= 7850 Kg m3 Volume of concrete of column = 1m3 Volume of steel rebar in concrete.Rebar Foundation Cost vs??

## crawlermoun fullymobile ted crushing plant
I bought a 10″x16″ jaw crusher from Mt.Baker Mining in February 2014 for crushing concrete and demolition debris.I have installed a 37 hp gasoline motor on the crusher so it is mobile and I can haul it on the back of my truck.The jaw crusher is working great! To say we are happy with what the jaw crusher can do is a serious understatement.&quot;How many pounds of rebar are in typical concerete per,It would depend on the CY of concrete For example,a cubic yard of concrete in a transferbeam will have FAR more rebar in it than a simple stem wall I believe 150lb cy is used pretty widely for.

The concrete structure is designed to act as a single unit,though parts of it are poured separately,resulting in a construction joint.The rebar has to carry through the joint for continuous resistance to stresses.It splices with the rebar on the other side,overlapping for a specified distance.Generally,the bars overlap by a minimum of 2.How to Tie Rebar: 15 Steps (with Pictures)27&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;How to Tie Rebar.Building with concrete involves many steps to achieve the best results,including forming,grading,placing,and finishing.One critical step is placing the reinforcing bars,or rebar,correctly,and this article will.
