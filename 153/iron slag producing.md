## What is slag cement
Molten slag diverted from the iron blast furnace is rapidly chilled,producing glassy granules that yield desired reactive cementitious characteristics when ground into cement fineness.Once the slag has been cooled and ground to a usable fineness it is stored and shipped to suppliers throughout the United States.Global Slag2 天前&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;About Global Slag.Global Slag addresses critical areas for slag producers and users alike for both the iron &amp; steel industry and for the cement and construction materials industries around the world.The Global Slag Conference is now established as the world's best meeting place for slag professionals.
