## Mineral processing
Crushing and grinding are the two primary comminution processes.Crushing is normally carried out on "run of mine" ore,while grinding (normally carried out after crushing) may be conducted on dry or slurried material.In comminution,the size reduction of particles is done by three types of forces: compression,impact and attrition.CHAPTER 20: SIZE REDUCTION EQUIPMENT FOR SIZE …States that the energy required for size reduction is proportional to the change in surface area of the pieces of food • E = K R 1 1 D.p.D.f • K.R Rittinger’s constant • For the size reduction of fine powders,in which large areas of new surface are being created,Rittinger's Law …

## Mineral processing
2&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Comminution is particle size reduction of materials.Comminution may be carried out on either dry materials or slurries.Crushing and grinding are the two primary comminution processes.Crushing is normally carried out on &quot;run of mine&quot; ore,while grinding (normally carried out after crushing) may be conducted on dry or slurried material.In.Extractive Metallurgy of Copper ScienceDirectCopper recovery from used automobiles and electronic devices follows a similar pattern,i.e.: Liberation by size reduction (shredding); isolation of copper by magnetic,specific gravity,and eddy current separation.The copper from these processes is then re smelted and re refined.Old (obsolete) scrap is often discarded in landfills.

## Mill (grinding)
14&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;A mill is a device that breaks solid materials into smaller pieces by grinding,crushing,or cutting.Such comminution is an important unit operation in many processes.There are many different types of mills and many types of materials processed in them.Historically mills were powered by hand (e.g.via a hand crank),working animal (e.g.Why Size Reduction is an Important Step in Pharmaceutical.Size reduction can be illustrated as the process in which the particle size of a substance or chemical is reduced.This process converts the substance or chemical to smaller pieces,powders,coarse particles,or an advanced type of subdivision.The synonymous terms “comminution” and “grinding” are used for the process of size reduction.
