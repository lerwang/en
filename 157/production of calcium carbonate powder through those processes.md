## Calcium carbonate
Calcium carbonate is a chemical compound with the formula CaCO3.It is a common substance found in rocks as the minerals calcite and aragonite (most notably as limestone,which is a type of sedimentary rock consisting mainly of calcite) and is the main component of pearls and the shells of marine organisms,snails,and eggs.Calcium carbonate.CementCement powder,here conditioned in bag,is mixed with fine and coarse aggregates and water.A cement is a binder,a substance used for construction that sets,hardens,and adheres to other materials to bind them together.Cement is seldom used on its own,but rather to bind sand and gravel (aggregate) together.Cement mixed with fine aggregate.
