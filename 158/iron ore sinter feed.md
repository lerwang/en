## Iron Ore
Iron ore is used directly in the steelmaking process in the blast furnace in the form of lump,pellet,and fines (see Fig.5).(Fines are converted to sinter feed in a sinter plant.) Iron ore pellets are also used in the production of DRI and HBI.What is the difference between pellets and sinter?What is Pelletization? The process of Pelletization helps converting Iron Ore Fines into “Uniform Size Iron Ore Pellets” that can be fed in the blast furnaces or in the DRI kiln (DRI).Why Pelletization? Pelletization is the only answer to a major.
