## Cement Plant
Robert G.Blezard,in Lea's Chemistry of Cement and Concrete (Fourth Edition),1998The modern cement plant is highly capital intensive but economy restraints,environmental requirements and market demand have affected the scale of operations.The calcareous cement industry in the UK reached a maximum size in the 1960s,and then began to decline.Cement plant Rohožn&#237;kOur cement workshop in Rohožn&#237;k writes its history since 1971,when it began its construction.The first cloud saw the world’s light in 1976.Since then,the plant has undergone many major changes and today it is among the most advanced and most advanced in

## Cement clinker
Cement clinker is a solid material produced in the manufacture of Portland cement as an intermediary product.Clinker occurs as lumps or nodules,usually 3 millimetres (0.12 in) to 25 millimetres (0.98 in) in diameter.It is produced by sintering (fusing together without melting to the point of liquefaction) limestone and aluminosilicate materials such as clay during the cement kiln stage.About Cement 2020The Bath cement plant,about 30 km west of Kingston,Ontario along the shore of the Bay of Quinte that produces 1.1 million tonnes of cement per year.That’s enough cement to build 70 CN Towers each year.Energy is a central component of sustainability.
