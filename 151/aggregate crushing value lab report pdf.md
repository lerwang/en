## How to Find Aggregate Crushing Value and Its Test Procedure?
Aggregate Crushing Value and Its Test Procedure: One of the test in which concrete material can fail is due to crushing under compressive stress.Aggregate crushing test is standardized by IS: 2386 partIV and used to verify the crushing strength of aggregates.The aggregates should be oven dried,which can passes through 12.5mm and retained onAggregate Crushing Value TestFor this reason assessment of strength of the aggregate is made by using a sample of bulk aggregate in a standardized manner.This testing method is known as an aggregate crushing value test.Aggregate crushing value provides the resistance of an aggregate sample to crushing under gradually applied compressive load.
