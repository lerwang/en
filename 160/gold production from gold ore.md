## The CIP Production Line Process of Gold Ore
【Process Introduction】 Generally,the CIP production line process of gold ore is a no filter cyanide carbon in pulp technological process.In this process,the activated carbon has been used directly to adsorption and recovery gold from cyanide pulp.The environmental impact of gold production25&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;This indicates that attempts to lessen the environmental impact of gold production should focus on these two stages.Mining and comminution are highly dependent on the grade of gold ore,as the lower the grade,the greater the amount that needs to be mined and the more crushing and grinding is required to extract the gold from the ore.
