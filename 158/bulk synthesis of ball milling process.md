Ball milling is often used not only for grinding powders but also for oxides or nanocomposite synthesis and or structure phase composition optimization [14,41].Mechanical activation by ball milling is known to increase the material reactivity and uniformity of spatial distribution of elements [63].Ball Mill Synthesis of Bulk Quaternary Cu 2 ZnSnSe 4 and …&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;The synthesis process comprises three steps viz.wet ball milling of the elemental precursors,vacuum annealing,and densification by hot pressing.The purpose of this is to evaluate the feasibility of introducing wet milling in place of vacuum melting in …
