## Mines: Fluorite Mines
9&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Fluorite is widely occurring as a primary mineral in granites and other igneous rocks.It is also a common minor constituent of dolostone and limestone.But both occurances are of little economic interest,as the amount is very low.Fluorite is mined solely from hydrothermal veins or gangues,typically found around granite.Granite intrusions.How stainless steel is madeStainless steel is an iron containing alloy—a substance made up of two or more chemical elements—used in a wide range of applications.soft drinks and fruit juice are processed in stainless steel equipment.Stainless steel is also used in commercial cookers,pasteurizers,transfer bins,and other specialized equipment.Advantages.

## How Is Iron Extracted From the Earth? Reference.com
Iron ores in the form of hematite (ferrous oxide) and magnetite are removed from the earth through mining.The use of heavy mining equipment is necessary to dig out large pits in an area with a large deposit of iron ore; however,because iron does not occur naturally,it is necessary to use a blast furnace to separate or refine iron from the other substances in the iron ore.Extracting Lead Materials from Ore31&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Extracting Lead Materials from Ore.Lead is a dense,soft,low melting metal.Lead is the densest common metal except for gold,and this quality makes it effective in sound barriers and as a shield against X rays.Lead resists corrosion by water,so it makes a long lasting roofing material.Only about half of the lead materials used today are produced from mining,the rest is obtained from.
