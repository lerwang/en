## Uranium processing
Uranium milling After mining,uranium ore is transported to a nearby mill for processing.The first step is to crush the ore and mix it with water so that it can move through a series of mill circuits.After crushing,the ore is treated with acid in large tanks,to separate the uranium from other minerals in the rock.The uranium is now part of a liquid solution,which is then separated from.pper ore refining processCopper extraction WikipediaCopper extraction refers to the methods used to obtaining copper from its ores.The conversion of copper consists of a series of phy Primary mobile crushing plant Independent operating combined mobile crushing station Mobile

## Ore Refining
The recovery of metals from sulfide rich ore bodies proceeds through a series of steps: from mining to crushing to mineral recovery,followed typically by smelting of the sulfide ores,and thence to metal refining; although the nature of the ore body dictates theSilver OreSilver is quite different from gold because it is nearly always found within ores that require specialized mining techniques to extract.Silver ore is one of the most important resources on Earth.After processing and refining silver is used for countless industrial uses
