## What is the Difference Between Concrete and Cement?
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;The primary difference between concrete and cement is that concrete is a composite material made of water,aggregate,and cement.Cement is a very fine powder made of limestone and other minerals,which absorbs water and acts as a binder to hold the concrete together.While cement is a construction material in its own right,concrete cannot be made without cement.Cement ProductionCement production has undergone tremendous developments since its beginnings some 2,000 years ago.While the use of cement in concrete has a very long history ( Malinowsky,1991 ),the industrial production of cements started in the middle of the 19 th century,first with shaft kilns,which were later replaced by rotary kilns as standard.
