## Simulation of Size Reduction in Ball Mills and DEM
Simulation of Size Reduction in Ball Mills and DEM.Another reason for the early success of DEM in tumbling mill simulation lies in the fact that the most common grinding media are balls,typically made of steel and other ferrous alloys.the most common tumbling mill test used in the lab is the Bond ball mill grindability test,used for.Effect of the operating parameter and grinding media on20191216&ensp&#0183&enspFurthermore,the discrete element method (DEM) simulation showed that the wear behavior on the upper surface is higher than that on the side surface of the lifter.The DEM simulation with Archard wear model is an effective tool to investigate the wear distribution on the lifter,which is in good consistent with the wear behavior measured by the
