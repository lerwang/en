## What is the bulk density of limestone
For this reason,the bulk density of powders is usually reported both as &quot;freely settled&quot; and &quot;tapped&quot; density (where the tapped density refers to the bulk density of the powder after a specified.The Density of Common Rocks and MineralsThe densities of rocks and minerals are normally expressed as specific gravity,which is the density of the rock relative to the density of water.This isn't as complex as you may think because water's density is 1 gram per cubic centimeter or 1 g cm 3.Therefore.
