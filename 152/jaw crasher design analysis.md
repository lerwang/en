crusher,Jaw crusher and Impact crusher Our objective is to design various components of an Impact crusher like drive mechanism,shaft,rotor,hammers,casing,feed and discharge mechanism which will be useful in minimizing weight,cost and maximizing the capacity Impact crushers: they involve the use of impact rather than pressure to crushJaw Crusher Working PrincipleIn addition to the wear problem of the jaw plate,there are many other problems caused by parts and components can not be ignored Next,we will introduce the failure analysis and troubleshooting of the jaw crusher The main engine suddenly stopped Cause analysis: The discharge port is blocked,causing full cavity blocking;
