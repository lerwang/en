## Grinding Mill
Basket Mill is comprising of grinding &amp; mixing chamber made of cylindrical shall (Jacked and Non Jacketed) with perforated screened bottam end and open or screeed perforated top cover.The product is circulated by pumping dispersing impeller positioned on mill shaft under grinding chamber(and or above grinding chember) sucks the product through the grinding zone filled with small grinding media.Outotec HIGmill high intensity grinding mill OutotecThe mill heights can be varied to optimize the media load and power input for specific appliions.Chamber volumes range from 5 to 30,000 liters with corresponding drives from 5 to 5000 kW.The HIGmill is the only ultrafine grinding technology in commercial use that can use smallsize highdensity grinding media in mill sizes above 3000 kW.
