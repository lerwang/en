## Steelmaking
Steelmaking is the process of producing steel from iron ore and or scrap.In steelmaking,impurities such as nitrogen,silicon,phosphorus,sulfur and excess carbon (most important impurity) are removed from the sourced iron,and alloying elements such as manganese,nickel,chromium,carbon and vanadium are added to produce different grades of steel.steel mills railways royalgardenJun 25,2019This innovation meant that,finally,iron ore from anywhere in the world could be used to make steel.Not surprisingly,steel production costs began decreasing significantly.Prices for steel rail dropped more than 80% between 1867 and 1884,as a result of the new steel producing techniques,initiating growth of the world steel
