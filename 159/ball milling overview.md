In the production of ethanol,wet ball milling is the process used,because of its versatile process.It produces more products than dry ball milling,but in terms of efficiency,capital,and operating cost,most ethanol plants in the USA prefer to use dry ball milling process.In other words,dry ball milling is cost efficient in ethanol.End Mills MillingEnd Mills Milling.Guhring is somewhat unique amongst carbide end mill manufacturers in that Guhring produces its own carbide rod,which is the substrate material for all Guhring carbide end mills.This ability to control the quality and supply of carbide rod gives Guhring carbide end mills longer and more repeatable tool life and performance.
