## What’s the difference of Ball mill,SAG mill,AG mill?
29&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Attrition mill is a type of grinding mill by kinds of media to crush lump to powder like substances.The impact can be rock on rock such as in an Autogenous Grinding (AG) mill,rock and a small ball charge (~10%),used in Semi Autogenous Grinding (SAG) mills,balls of various sizes in Ball Mills and less commonly these days,steel rods in Rod Mills.Ball Mill: Operating principles,components,Uses.The balls which could be of different diameter occupy 30 % of the mill volume and its size depends on the feed and mill size.The large balls tend to break down the coarse feed materials and the smaller balls help to form fine product by reducing void spaces between the balls.Ball mills grind material by impact and attrition.

## Ball Mills Remas
Ball mills are used to obtain a product size below 150 microns.With the rotation of the mill,collision and attrition forces grind down the material in the mill chamber.The balls act as the grinding media,where contact points are created with each other and the material is either crushed or ground.
