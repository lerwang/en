## Flexible operation of coal fired power plants Processing.
To do so,the coal dust inlet was to be clearly reduced.To realize this,one mill operation without backup fire with oil or gas burners was used.It turned out that the quality of the used coal can have a stronger effect on the characteristics of fly and wet ash than it had before.The reason: Operation with only one coal mill is.Pulverizer Application for High Volatile High Moisture CoalsFigure 4 compares a conventional vertical table type pulverizer with a ball tube mill pulverizing system with crusher dryer.The table type pulverizer allows high temperature air to reach the coal charge.The ball mill system with crusher dryer normally reduces the inlet temperature to less than the auto ignition point of the coal charge.
