## Crushers
Impactors produce cubic products,and they can offer high reduction ratios as long as the feed material is not too fine.This means that in certain cases it is possible to use a single impact crusher to carry out a task normally done in several crushing stages using compressing crushers (i.e.jaw,gyratory,and or cone crushers).Introduction to Rock Crushers&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Jaw crushers offer reduction ratios of up to about 6:1,while cone crushers can reduce material size up to a maximum of 8:1 ratio.The finer the crushing,the smaller the reduction ratio.As a basic rule,jaw crushers are the primary crusher taking the mined aggregate and reducing i
