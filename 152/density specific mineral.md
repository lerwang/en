## Difference Between Density and Specific Gravity …
8&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The key difference between density and specific gravity is that density is an absolute value,while specific gravity is a relative value for a substance.Density and specific gravity are the two commonly used terms that are often confused with each other.Particularly,in industries,these terms are widely important to weigh different substance and to calculate the concentration of liquids.Minerals13&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Density or specific gravity is the ratio of the weight of a substance to the weight of an equal volume of water.Density = Weight Volume.Steps to determine the density of a mineral.1) Use a balance.In this example the balance to be used is a triple beam balance.The closest minerla having this density is galena with a density of 7.60 g.

## Mineral Oils Specific Gravity
Mineral oils specific gravity is important when dealing with electrical equipment.If the oil has a high density the water present would float to the top,which would decrease the oils effectiveness.The API Gravity is a special form of specific gravity that is used to measure of how heavy or light a petroleum liquid is in comparison to water.The Density of Common Rocks and MineralsThe densities of rocks and minerals are normally expressed as specific gravity,which is the density of the rock relative to the density of water.This isn't as complex as you may think because water's density is 1 gram per cubic centimeter or 1 g cm 3.Therefore,these numbers translate directly to g cm 3,or tonnes per cubic meter (t m 3).
