## How Split set Rock Bolt and Friction Bolts Work
22&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Rock bolts can be installed quickly,usually in less than a minute,using a jack drill,a stoper,a roof bolting jumbo,or any other type of drill.Installation can be done in a few easy steps: Drill the hole.Replace the drill steel with a driver tool.Slide the plate on the tube.Drive the tube in with the drill drifter; Rock Bolt Pull.Rock BoltUse Swellex rock bolts for applications where higher yield and breaking strength are required.Swellex Premium line is engineered to provide safety and productivity in areas where stiff rock bolting is expected to work within its elastic range and to minimize the deformation in and around the excavation.

## The Quality Control of Rock Bolts
The test program began with pull tests because these have been a widely used control method when checking that bolts have been properly installed.Complementary to the pull tests it was decided to try to have a more detailed look at different rock bolts in situ.The basic requirements for this were: the rock bolt itself should not be damaged.Safety in Swellex Epiroc28&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Atlas Copco personnel completed onsite training on the Swellex bolts installation and inflation arm instruction using both the PSP 300RDP air operated pump and H1 hydraulic Swellex pumps.Part of the product offering was to train Technicore personnel in the use of our pull test equipment for both the PM12 and MN24 Swellex bolts.

## Rock bolt
24&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;A rock bolt is a long anchor bolt,for stabilizing rock excavations,which may be used in tunnels or rock cuts.It transfers load from the unstable exterior to the confined (and much stronger) interior of the rock mass.Rock bolts were first used in mining in the 1890s,with systematic use documented at the St Joseph Lead Mine in the U.S.in.Tension Jack Pull Test KitThe pull test kit consists of two assemblies: a mechanical assembly which includes a claw,stand,nut,&amp; spindle; a hydraulic assembly which includes a hollow core ram,hand pump,gauge,&amp; hose; The gauge measures pressure,which is easily converted into tons of load; Suitable for testing virtually all types of rock bolts and soil nails
