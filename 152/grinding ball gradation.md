## Ball Mill In Cement Plant
Ball mill is the cement crushing equipment in the cement plant.Compared with open circuit ball mill,the closed circuit ball mill has high efficiency,high output,low cement temperature,and good comprehensive benefit.It is the best choice for a cement plant.Ball sorter Magotteaux17&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;2 nd chamber: the balls gradation has to be respected to avoid a too fine ball charge which could lose permeability and clog the outlet grates slots.Sorting to repeat every 4 years; Magotteaux ball sorter allows achieving the above in a fast and safe manner,requiring little manpower.

## The grinding balls bulk weight in fully unloaded mill
Thus,during calculating the grinding balls mass in ball mill (after measuring the mill filling degree with grinding media) needs to use the grinding balls bulk weight whose diameter was determined earlier.In this case,it may be differ from the grinding balls bulk weight loaded to the mill.Winnermac : 201818&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Ball mill is the key equipment for materials to be smashed after crushing,which is widely used in cement,silicate products,new construction materials,refractory,chemical fertilizer,black and non ferrous metals,glass chinaware and other production industries.
