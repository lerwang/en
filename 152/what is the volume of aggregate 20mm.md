## Aggregate Properties
1&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;A majority of the volume of concrete (60 80%) is occupied by aggregate.In fact,for most conventional concretes,more than 75% of the volume is aggregate.Aggregates are essential in concrete from the point of view of economy (since cement is expensive),dimensional stability (aggregates do not easily creep or shrink),stiffness,and.Density of Aggregate8&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Density is an important parameter for aggregate.For aggregates,density is determined by multiplying the relative density (specific gravity) of the aggregate times the density of water.The bulk density or unit weight of an aggregate is the mass or weight of the aggregate that required to fill a container of a specified unit volume.
