Limestone Limestone is a carbonate sedimentary rock that is often composed of the skeletal fragments of marine organisms such as coral,foraminifera,and molluscs Its major materials are the minerals calcite and aragonite,which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) A closely related rock is dolomite,which contains a high percentage of the mineral,Environmental Hazards of Limestone Mining SciencingEnvironmental Hazards of Limestone Mining.These contaminants can also include material like oil and gas from mining equipment.Because contaminants in ground water move faster through limestone than other types of rocks,quarries in karst areas must be especially careful.Quarrying also removes the entire subcutaneous zone,an important.
