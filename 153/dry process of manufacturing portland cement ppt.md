## 11.6 Portland Cement Manufacturing
11.6 Portland Cement Manufacturing 11.6.1 Process Description 7 Portland cement is a fine powder,gray or white in color,that consists of a mixture of hydraulic cement materials comprising primarily calcium silicates,aluminates and aluminoferrites.More than 30.What Are the Differences Between the Wet and Dry …What Are the Differences Between the Wet and Dry Processes of a Cement Manufacturer? The wet process of cement manufacturing involves adding water to finely crushed raw material,such as limestone,clay or iron ore,in a proportion of 35 to 50 percent water to 50 to 65 percent raw material to make a slurry that is fed into a cement kiln,whereas no water is added in the dry process.
