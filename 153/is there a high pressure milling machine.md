## Milling (machining)
Milling is the process of machining using rotary cutters to remove material[1] by advancing a cutter into a work piece.This may be done varying direction[2] on one or several axes,cutter head speed,and pressure.[3] Milling covers a wide variety of different operations and machines,on scales from small individual parts to large,heavy duty.Machining Processes: Turning,Milling,and Drilling …There’s a lot that goes into machining a perfectly smooth,precise,functional workpiece.It requires great attention to detail and experience.Turning,drilling,and milling are just a few of the most common machining processes.They’ve been around for many
