## Flotation ore dressing Britannica
Flotation is widely used to concentrate copper,lead,and zinc minerals,which commonly accompany one another in their ores.Many complex ore mixtures formerly of little value have become major sources of certain metals by means of the flotation process.RECOVERY OF COPPER FROM COPPER SLAG AND COPPER SLAG FLOTATION …Copper dissolution was generally found to be the dominant process within the first 60 minutes of reaction,whereas iron dissolution dominated afterwards.Keywords: copper slag,copper slag flotation tailings,leaching,sulphuric acid,ferric sulphate,hydrogen.
