Concrete,the mix of aggregates with water and cement,is flying off.Its best commercially traced and documented component,Portland cement or its variants,has been experiencing an unprecedented development since the turn of the millennium,matched only during a few years after WW2 [,].Almost twenty years after this rebound,no obvious sign of slowing down is detectable,as this paper is.Magazine of Concrete Research Vol 72,No 11Magazine of Concrete Research covers every aspect of concrete manufacture and behaviour from performance and evaluation of constituent materials to mix design,testing,durability,structural analysis and composite construction.To submit to the journal is free.Papers appear Ahead of Print (below) as soon as they are ready to be published.
