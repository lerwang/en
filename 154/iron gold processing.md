## The Gold Smelting Process
Gold smelting is more involved then simply heating and melting gold.This process not only heats the gold to a liquid state,but also removes impurities.Gold miners have to smelt their gold in order to remove impurities resulting in pure gold.Most large scale gold.Ore processing operations at Newmont Boddington Gold …Some gold is also associated with native bismuth and bismuthinite and the iron sulphides in the deposit (Dunne et al,2007).Comminution Circuit The Boddington primary crushing circuit comprises two 60” x 113” XHD primary gyratory crushers located at the edge of the mine with a nominal capacity of 3,670 t h each at an OSS (open side setting) of 175mm.
