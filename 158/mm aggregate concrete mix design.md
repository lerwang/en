Mix design is a process of specifying the mixture of ingredients required to meet anticipated properties of fresh and hardened concrete.OR The process of selecting suitable ingredients of concrete and determining their relative amounts with the objective of producing a concrete of the required,strength,durability,and workability as economically as possible,is termed the concrete mix design.What is the effect of coarse aggregate size in compressive …When we design mix the concrete,its target strength is much less than the compressive strength of the aggregates used in the formation.It can also be clearly seen in the mix design procedure that greater the maximum size of coarse aggregate use.
