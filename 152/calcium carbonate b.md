## Calcium Carbonate
Calcium carbonate (also known as chalk),mined as calcite,is the most commonly used filler for PVC.It is discussed in detail in Section 8.4.1.It is usually surface treated with stearic acid,producing a layer of calcium stearate on the filler surface.This results in improved processing and dispersion (mechanical properties) and improved.Study of Calcium Carbonate Precipitation under a …25&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Calcium carbonate was precipitated from a supersaturated calcium bicarbonate solution in association with a series of long chain fatty acid monolayers,and the location of the growing crystals with respect to the monolayer domain structure was determined by in situ analysis using a Brewster angle microscope (BAM).Increase in the chain length from palmitic acid (C16) to triacontanoic acid (C30.
