## Revised OSHA Silica Standards Overview 03.
OSHA has reduced the permissible exposure limit for crystalline silica.The new standards were to take effect June 23,but OSHA delayed implementation until recently.These new standards are now implemented.Key provisions of the revised silica standard include: Reduction of the permissible exposure limit for dust from 100 μg m3 to 50 μg m3 over an eight hour time weighted average and.SilicaSilica is one of the most common hazards on a worksite,particularly in the construction,oil and gas,manufacturing,and agriculture industries.Silica dust can cause silicosis,a serious and irreversible lung disease.It can also cause lung cancer.Cutting,breaking,crushing,drilling,grinding,or blasting concrete or stone releases the dust.
