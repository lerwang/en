## Cement clinker
Cement clinker is a solid material produced in the manufacture of Portland cement as an intermediary product.Clinker occurs as lumps or nodules,usually 3 millimetres (0.12 in) to 25 millimetres (0.98 in) in diameter.It is produced by sintering (fusing together without melting to the point of liquefaction) limestone and aluminosilicate materials such as clay during the cement kiln stage.RAW MATERIALS IN CEMENT PRODUCTIONThe main materials used in cement production are minerals containing calcium oxide,silex,alumina and iron oxide.These components are rarely found in one type of raw material; therefore,for the cement production the raw mix is selected for the following
