## AGGREGATE IMPACT VALUE TEST 10+ IMPORTANT NOTES TO,
Jul 16,2014&#0183;&#32;Aggregate impact value test gives an indication of aggregate’s toughness property (ie property of a material to resist impact) Aggregate impact values are used to classify the stone aggregates with respect to toughness property as given below Aggregate impact value (%) Toughness PropertiesAggregate Crushing Value TestThis testing method is known as an aggregate crushing value test.Aggregate crushing value provides the resistance of an aggregate sample to crushing under gradually applied compressive load.Generally,the test is conducted on aggregate passing 12.5 mm and retained on 10 mm sieve.

## The Effect of Aggregate Properties on Concrete
30&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The Effect of Aggregate Properties on Concrete Concrete is a mixture of cementious material,aggregate,and water.Aggregate is commonly considered inert filler,which accounts for 60 to 80 percent of the volume and 70 to 85 percent of the weight of concrete.Aggregate Impact ValueAggregate impact value = (B A) x 100% iii) Two such tests should be carried out and the mean of the results should be reported.Saurav Sadhukhan Novem at 10:35 am.What is the practical implementation of the test? How are the test conditions experienced in real life? Reply Link Quote.Prasad Novem at 3:11 am.
