Liberation: Cyanide leaching will only be effective if the cyanide can come in contact with the gold particle.For this to happen,the ore should either be sufficiently porous for cyanide to reach the gold,or more usually the ore is crushed and ground to a size at which the surface of the gold is exposed i.e.the gold is liberated.Thermodynamic analysis of free cyanide determination byThe analysis of free cyanide by titration with silver nitrate,when no metals are present in the solution,is well known and consists of the reaction of the ionic silver added with the ionic cyanide present in the solution to form the argentocyanide ion,as presented in equation (1) Agzz2CN{~Ag(CN){2 (1) Once all the cyanide has reacted,if no
