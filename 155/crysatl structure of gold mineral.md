## Copper
Copper is a chemical element with the symbol Cu (from Latin: cuprum) and atomic number 29.It is a soft,malleable,and ductile metal with very high thermal and electrical conductivity.A freshly exposed surface of pure copper has a pinkish orange color.Copper is used as a conductor of heat and electricity,as a building material,and as a.Quartz: The mineral Quartz information and picturesQuartz is an important mineral with numerous uses.Sand,which is composed of tiny Quartz pebbles,is the primary ingredient for the manufacture of glass.Transparent Rock Crystal has many electronic uses; it is used as oscillators in radios,watches,and pressure gauges,and in the study of optics.

## Crystal structure
Gold is one of the first minerals used by prehistoric cultures.The Latin name for this mineral was &quot;aurum&quot; and J&#246;ns Jakob Berzelius used Au to represent the element when he established the current system of chemical symbols.The Old English word &quot;gold&quot; first.Identifying MineralsEvery mineral has two different names: &gt;Mineralogical,e.g.pyrite,quartz.&gt;Chemical,e.g.iron sulphide FeS2 or silicon dioxide SiO2.Well formed crystals of some minerals will also have a gemmological name,e.g.peridot is clear,gemstone quality olivine.
