## Processing of Metal Powders Weebly
Powder injection molding (p 497) has become an important process because of its versatility and economics Complex shapes can be obtained at high production rates using powder metals that are blended with a polymer or wax (see PIM in Fig 1714 on p 495) Also,the parts can be produced with high density to net or near net shapePowder Production Maschine TechnologyThe most common method of metal powder production Elemental feedstock is melted under an air or inert gas blanket,or under vacuum The chamber is then backfilled with gas to force molten alloy through a nozzle where high velocity air,N,He or Ar gas impinges onto the flowing melt and breaks it up Powder is mostly spherical,with some.
