## Loesche Grinding Mills for Ores and Minerals
Thanks to its grinding plants with throughputs of 2t h to 1,000t h for the cement industry and self inert,central coal grinding plants for hard and brown coal power stations,LOESCHE is the global market leader for vertical roller mills and turnkey grinding mills.Vertimill&#174;Motor power and media addition.The power drawn by the Vertimill motor is required to establish the grinding rate.Motor power should be measured using corrected power.As the grinding media wears fine enough to be carried out by the uprising velocity in the mill,the total media charge will diminish,and the power draw will decrease.
