## The Role of Chelation in the Treatment of Other Metal.
12&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;General Chelation Considerations.In thinking broadly about chelation,a “reduction to absurdity” or oversimplification occurs with a construct that supposes when a chelator (ligand) is administered: (1) the sole metal of interest is simply “purged” from the organism and (2) this process is entirely beneficial,improving patient symptoms and outcomes absent any adverse effects.Removal of iron and manganese from drinking water …&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Alum and lime were added for coagulation and pH correction.Jar test studies revealed that treatment with potassium permanganate at pH 7.7 8.0 was effective in the removal of iron,manganese and organics,which were responsible for causing colour and odour to water.The studies helped in improvements in water quality for safe drinking water.

## Manganese Ore
Manganese (Mn) is the twelfth most abundant element in the Earth's crust.Amonst about 300 minerals containing manganese only about a dozen are of economic significance.The two main manganese minerals are pyrolusite (MnO 2) and rhodochrosite (MnCO 3).Manganese is the fourth most used metal in terms of tonnage after iron,aluminium and copper.manganese is the fourth most used metal after iron.Manganese is used in steel making to remove sulphur and oxygen from carbon steels to increase hardness and strength.About 14mtpa of manganese content is used each year to make 17.5mtpa manganese alloys to make manganese the fourth most used metal after iron,aluminium and copper.
