## Basic properties
Basic properties.The following Table gives the compressive strengths (based on cylinders and cubes),modulus of elasticity and tensile strength for various strength classes of normal weight concrete.They are taken from Table 3.1 of the Eurocode 2,which gives additional properties as well as values for other strength classes.Concrete Properties,Testing &amp; StandardsConcrete strength increases with time where moisture is available.However,it is accepted that around 80% of the strength is reached at an age of 28 days and so this is the length of time a concrete cube is stored,in controlled conditions before testing.
