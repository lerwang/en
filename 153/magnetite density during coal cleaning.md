## Estimating tons of coal on a property,Kentucky Geological …
The specific gravity of coal is important during coal cleaning because many of the common mineral impurities in coal have much higher specific gravity (density) than coal.For example,the specific gravity of pyrite (fool's gold),a common impurity in coal,and the main source of sulfur in coal,is 4.9 to 5.2.Coal preparation plantA coal preparation plant (CPP; also known as a coal handling and preparation plant (CHPP),coal handling plant,prep plant,tipple or wash plant) is a facility that washes coal of soil and rock,crushes it into graded sized chunks (sorting),stockpiles grades preparing it for transport to market,and more often than not,also loads coal into rail cars,barges,or ships.
