## When do you need a soft starter for an AC motor?
A soft starter (solid state starter) allows current to be limited (top) during motor starting.The corresponding torque reduction (bottom) is proportional to the square of the reduction in voltage.It’s important to note that a VFD (variable frequency drive) can provide the same controlled starting and stopping functions that a soft starter provides,albeit in a different way — by varying.BALL MILL DRIVE MOTOR CHOICES23&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;BALL MILL DRIVE MOTOR CHOICES.The time has come to re think our approach to mill drive motors because of the growth in size of newer ball mills,the starting torque restrictions of some of the newer mill drive configurations,and the softness of some utility services.one of the proposed mills included a gear box that was not suitable.
