## How to Make Copper Sulfate
Copper sulfate crystals are among the most beautiful crystals you can grow,but you might not have access to a chemistry lab or want to order the copper sulfate from a chemical supply company.That's okay because you can make copper sulfate yourself using readily available materials.The Extraction of CopperExtracting copper from its ores.The method used to extract copper from its ores depends on the nature of the ore.Sulfide ores such as chalcopyrite (\(CuFeS 2\)) are converted to copper by a different method from silicate,carbonate or sulfate ores.
