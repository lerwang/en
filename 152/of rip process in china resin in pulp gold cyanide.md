## Gold Extraction Overview
Gold minerals is usually treated by cyanide leaching process including heap cyanide leaching,CIP (carbon in pulp),RIP (resin in pulp) and CIL (carbon in leaching).Those gold ore whose leaching rate is less than 80% by conventional cyanide leaching even for 30 hours is considered as refractory gold …Resin in Pulp and Resin in SolutionApplication of ion exchange resins to the recovery of gold is described.Significant developments around gold selective anion exchange resins and the commercialization of at least two of these products have made resin in pulp (RIP) available as an alternative to CIP for the upgrading of gold from cyanided pulps.
