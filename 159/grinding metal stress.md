## Eight tips for effective grinding
The act of grinding can be deceivingly simple.But the devil’s in the details.Effective grinding requires operators to apply enough pressure at the correct angle to let the grains—the “cutting tool” of a grinding disc—remove the most metal in the shortest time,while not prematurely wearing the disc or burning out the grinding tool.Residual stress2&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Residual stress may be desirable or undesirable.For example,laser peening imparts deep beneficial compressive residual stresses into metal components such as turbine engine fan blades,and it is used in toughened glass to allow for large,thin,crack and scratch resistant glass displays on smartphones.However,unintended residual stress in.

## Stress relieving on metal products
1&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Stress relieving is normally done after rough machining,but before final finishing such as polishing or grinding.Parts that have tight dimensional tolerances,and are going to be further processed,for example by nitrocarburising,must be stress relieved.Welded structures can be made tension free by stress relieving.Application &amp; materialsgrinding abrasion cnkiThe main failure form of pulping scroll cover is high stress grinding abrasion accompanying corrosive abrasion.。 The impact experiment is accomplished with moving load

## GRINDING
Grinding is similar to turning with a negative rake angle.The two key things to remember with grinding: 1.Grit must be harder than the alloy you are grinding 2.Only sharp grit grinds the workpiece The grinding process involves cutting,then plowing (i.e.the wheel plows through the metal…Grinding (abrasive cutting)24&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Grinding is a subset of cutting,as grinding is a true metal cutting process.Each grain of abrasive functions as a microscopic single point cutting edge (although of high negative rake angle),and shears a tiny chip that is analogous to what would conventionally be called a &quot;cut&quot; chip (turning,milling,drilling,tapping,etc.) [citation needed].

## How to relieve stress in welding
When the metal is unclamped,the weld metal pulls at the base metal,and the weld distorts.The degree to which this occurs depends on the weld joint geometry,part design,and material grade and thickness.Generally,the higher the metal's carbon content,and the more restrained a joint is,the greater the stress.Sullivan Metals: metal grinding,metal milling.Sullivan Metals: metal grinding,metal milling.
