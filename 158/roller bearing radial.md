## The Difference Between Ball Bearings and Roller Bearings
There are two different types of loading with bearings; thrust and radial.If your bearing is working with a radial load,this means the bearing will rotate,or roll when put under tension.Alternatively,a thrust load will be subject to force dependant on the angle.Bearings have been around for hundreds of years and have many different uses,some of which include aiding in rolling (a tire.Roller bearings:Radial roller bearings Products by Type.Cylindrical roller bearings include the HT type that modifies the shape of roller end surfaces and ribs to increase axial load capacity,and the E type that has a special internal design to increase radial …
