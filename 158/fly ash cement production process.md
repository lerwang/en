## Fly ash
New fly ash production,i.e.the burning of coal,produces approximately 20 to 30 tons of CO 2 per ton of fly ash.Since the worldwide production of Portland cement is expected to reach nearly 2 billion tons by 2010,replacement of any large portion of thisUnderstand the equipment and process of pulverizing fly …JiangSu Lvssn is a large scale hi tech enterprise dealing with cement EPC and design and R&amp;D of related construction material &amp; equipment.Ultrafine pulverization is an important means to improve the activity and added value of fly ash.The finer the particle size.
