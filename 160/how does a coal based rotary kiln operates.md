## Coal based Direct Reduction Rotary Kiln Process.
The coal based direct reduction rotary kiln process was developed for converting iron ore directly into metallic iron without the melting of the materials.The process has the advantage of low capital expenditure and no requirement of coking coal.The metallic iron in this process is produced by the reduction of iron oxide below the fusion temperature of iron ore (1535 deg C) by utilizing.COMPARISON OF DIFFERENT COAL BASED DIRECT.The coal based processes can be grouped into four categories according to.The rotary kiln processes include ACCAR OSIL,DRC,Krupp CODIR and.different DR process concepts,many of which have been operated experimentally.
