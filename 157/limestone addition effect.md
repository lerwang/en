## Limestone
Limestone is a carbonate sedimentary rock that is often composed of the skeletal fragments of marine organisms such as coral,foraminifera,and molluscs.Its major materials are the minerals calcite and aragonite,which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO3).A closely related rock is dolomite,which contains a high.Effect of cement fineness and limestone additions on …The effects of 10% limestone addition to cement on strength development and sulphate expansion were also investigated.Compressive strength was significantly increased by higher fineness at all ages up to 180 days,while flexural strength was increased only
