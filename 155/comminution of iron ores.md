## Mineral processing
Sizing is the general term for separation of particles according to their size.The simplest sizing process is screening,or passing the particles to be sized through a screen or number of screens.Screening equipment can include grizzlies,bar screens,wedge wire screens,radial sieves,banana screens,multi deck screens,vibratory screen,fine screens,flip flop screens and wire mesh screens.Mineral processing metallurgy Britannica&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Mineral processing,art of treating crude ores and mineral products in order to separate the valuable minerals from the waste rock,or gangue.It is the first process that most ores undergo after mining in order to provide a more concentrated material for …
