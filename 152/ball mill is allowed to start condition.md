## Rawmill
For this reason,the rawmill is usually placed close to the kiln preheater.Types of dry rawmill include ball mills,roller mills and hammer mills.Ball mills.These are similar to cement mills,but often with a larger gas flow.The gas temperature is controlled by cold air bleeds to ensure a dry product without overheating the mill.Ball mill preventive maintenance,SAG mill,AG mill.Ball mill preventive maintenance (PM) It is a frequency work to maintain and repair ball mills,AG mills and SAG mills.The maintenance work influences the rotational speed and service life of ball mills.I
