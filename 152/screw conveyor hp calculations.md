How do I calculate the motor HP required for a screw conveyor? Mar 21,2019 It looks like you are in India,and perhaps this is a used screw conveyor that you obtained without the motor I think it would be a near impossible task to calculate this Here is what I would suggest: 1 Look for a nameplate on the screw conveyo.Conveyor Capacity TablesConveyor loadings may sometime exceed the recom&#173;mended % of Loading,listed in the materials table Considerations as to the material characteristics may justify up,
