## How To Calculate Cement,Sand,& Aggregate Quantity In 1,
03 08 2018&#0183;&#32;M 20 = 1 : 15 : 3 = 55,(Cement : Sand : Aggregate) Some of Mix is 55 Where,M = Mix 20 = Characteristic Compressive strength Consider volume of concrete = 1m3 Dry Volume of Concrete = 1 x 154 = 154 m3 (For Dry Volume Multiply By 154) Now we start calculation to find Cement,Sand and Aggregate quality in 1 cubic meter concretewhat is the typical weight of 1m3 of concreteConcrete weight calculator volume vs weight of concrete The weight of concrete can vary slightly depending on the mix type The most typical value widely used is 150 lb ft^3 for the most common ordinary concrete strength at ~ 4,000 psi = 4000 lbf (sq in)
