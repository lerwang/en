In case of using recycled aggregates in the manufacture of concrete blocks,we recommend that the quantity of these aggregates should not exceed 50% of the total quantity of aggregates.Finally,it might be useful to extend this experiment to cover other features of blocks such as porosity,insulation and fire resistance,as well as the study of the effect of plasticizers.Chapter 4&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Finally,Class R is for RCA aggregates and requires a concrete engineer to decide on the possibility and proportioning of these aggregates that can be used in PCC applications (Minnesota DOT 2016).Participating transportation agencies reported the required quality classes for fine and coarse virgin aggregates,RAP,RCA,SFS,and BFS used for construction of PCC slabs.
