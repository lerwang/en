## Stone,crushed volume to weight conversion
About Stone,crushed; 1 cubic meter of Stone,crushed weighs 1 602 kilograms [kg] 1 cubic foot of Stone,crushed weighs 10000959 pounds [lbs] Stone,crushed weighs 1602 gram per cubic centimeter or 1 602 kilogram per cubic meter,ie density of stone,crushed is equal to 1 602 kg m³In Imperial or US customary measurement system,the density is equal to 1000096 pound per cubic foot [lb.Calculate Quantities of Materials for Concrete Cement,…The quantities of materials for 1 m3 of concrete production can be calculated as follows: The weight of cement required = 7.29 x 50 = 364.5 kg.Weight of fine aggregate (sand) = 1.5 x 364.5 = 546.75 kg.Weight of coarse aggregate = 3 x 364.5 = 1093.5 kg.
