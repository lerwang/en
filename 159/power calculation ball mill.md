## THE OPTIMAL BALL DIAMETER IN A MILL
The ball impact energy on grain is proportional to the ball diameter to the third power: 3 E K 1 d b.(3) The coefficient of proportionality K 1 directly depends on the mill diameter,ball mill loading,milling rate and the type of grinding (wet dry).None of the characteristics of theCALCULATION OF THE POWER DRAW OF DRY …of the Bond ball mill grindability test.For all model based methods,a reliable method to calculate mill power draw for a given mill is required for the calculation of power draw.Morrell (1996) proposed a mathematical model for autogenous,semi autogenous and ball mills which is based on the motion of grinding charge inside the mill.
