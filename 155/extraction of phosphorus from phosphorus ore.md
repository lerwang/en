## Developments in chemical separation of iron ore
Gooden et al.(1974) reported phosphorus was not removed from an Australian ore from the Pilbara in a caustic or acid leach.However,Fisher White et al.(2013) were able to remove some phosphorus from an Australian Brockman Iron Formation ore sample by leaching with sodium hydroxide or sulfuric acid as shown in Table 12.1.Toward Resource Recovery from Wastewater: Extraction …We demonstrate the simultaneous extraction of phosphorus and clean water from digested sludge centrate using a forward osmosis (FO) membrane distillation (MD) hybrid process.In this FO MD hybrid process,FO concentrates orthophosphate and ammonium for subsequent phosphorus recovery in the form of struvite (MgNH4PO4&#183;6H2O),while MD is used to recover the draw solution and extract clean.
