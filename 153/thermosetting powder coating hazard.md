## Introduction to Powder Coating
applying thermosetting powder coatings so attractive to the coating company: 1) Powder is immediately ready for use 2) Less powder wastage during the application process 3) Reduced health hazard in case of exposure of operators 4) Superior cured filmPowder Coating MSDSPowder Coating reduces the health hazard to operators.As powders do not contain solvent (that are often found in wet paint) it noticeably reduces nose,mouth and throat irritation.Easy washable the powder can be removed from the skin easily by washing with warm water.

## What are the hazards of powder coatings?
Most powder coating resins are less toxic,and the curing agent is significantly more toxic than the resin.However,when formulated into a powder coating,the toxicity of the curing agent becomes very small or almost non toxic.Animal experiments have shown that.POWDER COATINGSThe powder particles melt in the flame and form a coating on the cold surface of the part.Preheating of the part is not necessary.The powders for flame spray is prepared from thermoplastic polymers.The method is generally used for coating large objects,which
