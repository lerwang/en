## Kaolin Al2H4O9Si2
Clay (kaolin) is a white to yellowish or grayish fine powder.There are at least three different minerals,kaolinite,dickite,and nacrite,classified as kaolin.Kaolinite or china clay is whiter,less contaminated with extraneous minerals,and less plastic in water.(b) In accordance with part 186.1(b)(1),the ingredient is used as an indirect.Heavy media separation and analysis BGS laboratory …Heavy media separations (HMS) are commonly used in the geosciences to divide crushed rocks or soils into their respective light and heavy specific gravity fractions e.g.gold panning where water provides the medium and the panning action separates the denser.
