## Black sand
Black sand is sand that is black in color.One type of black sand is a heavy,glossy,partly magnetic mixture of usually fine sands,found as part of a placer deposit.Another type of black sand,found on beaches near a volcano,consists of tiny fragments of basalt.While some beaches are predominantly made of black sand,even other color.SandSand is a granular material composed of finely divided rock and mineral particles.It is defined by size,being finer than gravel and coarser than silt.Sand can also refer to a textural class of soil or soil type; i.e.a soil containing more than 85 percent sand sized particles by mass.

## Mineral Extraction
When minerals are located deep within the ground,there are a variety of underground mining methods that can be utilized for excavation.The method is based primarily on whether the mineral is soft rock (i.e.coal) or hard rock (often those containing hard metals like copper or lead),and is often site specific—taking geologic,economic,and safety factors into consideration.OreOre is natural rock or sediment that contains desirable minerals,typically metals,that can be extracted from it.Ore is extracted from the earth through mining and refined,often via smelting,to extract the valuable element or elements.The grade of ore refers to the …
