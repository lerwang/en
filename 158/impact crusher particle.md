## What is an Impact Crusher? Telsmith
Impact Crushers are available in stationary,track,and portable configurations meeting any demand for any of these industries.Although Impact Crushers generally have a higher operating cost than other crushers,they tend to produce a more uniform particle shape (cubical) which is desirableCrusherImpact crusher.Impact crushers involve the use of impact rather than pressure to crush material.The material is contained within a cage,with openings on the bottom,end,or side of the desired size to allow pulverized material to escape.There are two types of impact crushers: horizontal shaft impactor and ver
