## WHAT ARE THE METHODS FOR COMPACTING CONCRETE IN THE FIELD,
May 08,2014&#0183;&#32;The various methods of hand compaction are as given below 1 Rodding It is a method of poking with 2m long,16 mm dia rod at sharp corners and edg The thickness of layers for rodding should be 15 to 20 cm 2 Ramming It is generally used for compaction on ground in plain concrete It is not used either in RCC or on upper floorsSelf Compacting ConcreteSelf compacting concrete (SCC) has been described as &quot;the most revolutionary development in concrete construction for several decades&quot;.
