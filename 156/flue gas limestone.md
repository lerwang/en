## Limestone gypsum FGD
Wet flue gas desulphurisation is usually based on the use of calcareous absorbents (for example limestone,calcium hydrate,quicklime or chalk).Industrially,the use of limestone as an absorbent has prevailed in the area of power stations.The limestone gypsum.Flue Gas Desulfurization Yokogawa Taiwan CorporationThe flue gas discharged from the boiler is fed into the absorber.In the absorber,a mixture of water and pulverized limestone is sprayed on the flue gas.The limestone slurry absorbs the sulfur dioxide (SO 2) contained in the flue gas reducing the emission of 2

## Retention of Arsenic and Selenium Compounds Using …
Volatile arsenic and selenium compounds present in coals may cause environmental problems during coal combustion and gasification.A possible way to avoid such problems may be the use of solid sorbents capable of retaining these elements from flue gases in gas cleaning systems.Lime and limestone are materials that are extensively employed for the capture of sulfur during coal processing.Air Pollution Control Technology Fact Sheetgallons of slurry per 1000 ft3 of flue gas (liters of slurry 1000Nm3 of flue gas).Oxidation of the slurry sorbent causes gypsum (calcium sulfate) scale to form in the absorber.Limestone forced oxidation (LSFO) is a newer process based on wet limestone scale.
