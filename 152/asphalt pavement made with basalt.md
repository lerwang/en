## Construction Reinforced Material Basalt Geogrid Mesh,
Pavement life between maintenance can be prolonged significantly Basalt reinforcing mesh makes it possible to reduce thickness of asphalt concrete pavement up to 20% Basalt Geogrid is more durable than metallic and glass fiber reinforcement due to basalt fiber's excellent performance Like all the basalt articles it is an ecologically safe.CN104072023AThe invention discloses a pavement made from an asphalt mixture.The pavement comprises the asphalt mixture and a reinforcing framework,wherein the reinforcing framework is a latticed framework made from basalt fiber composite bars; the weight percents of asphalt,rubbles,rubber particles,basalt fibers and mineral powder are respectively 32%,14%,14%,64% and 7%.
