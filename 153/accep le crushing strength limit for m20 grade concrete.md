## Average Compressive Strength
R.Dodge Woodson,in Concrete Portable Handbook,2012Average Compressive Strength The average compressive strength of concrete is determined from mathematical tables provided by your local code book or recommended supplemental reading,such as the Building Code Requirements for Structural Concrete and Commentary by the American Concrete Institute (ACI).TEST FOR WORKABILITY OF CONCRETE&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;The ease with which one can use concrete is called workability.It is one of the physical parameters of concrete which affects the finesse,strength and durability.Here’s how you can check the.
