## Frontiers Microstructure and Composition of Hardened …
In order to utilize industrial waste soda residue,a kind of binding material system based on soda residue slag cement has been developed.The microstructure and composition of hardened paste of the binding material system after curing for 28 days was analyzed.Copper slagCopper slag is a by product of copper extraction by smelting.During smelting,impurities become slag which floats on the molten metal.Slag that is quenched in water produces angular granules which are disposed of as waste or utilized as discussed below.

## Fly ash and slag
Low calcium (FA) and high calcium (HCFA) fly ash and granulated blast furnace slag (GBFS) are the most widely known,standardized and used SCMs in the composition of cement and concrete.In the last 4 years,scientific work has focused on improving binder.Ground granulated blast furnace slagthe chemical composition is similar to that of ordinary Portland cement.The shape and physical characteristics of iron and steel slag are similar to ordinary crushed stone and sand,however due to differences such as the chemical components and it is.
