## Mt Piper projects EnergyAustralia
A number of sustainable development projects are currently underway at Mt Piper power station.Nu Rock EnergyAustralia entered into an agreement with Nu Rock in 2014 to build a pilot plant that uses fly ash from Mt Piper power station to manufacture buildingClean Coal Technologies report(FGD) unit or spray dry scrubber,and NOx emissions can be reduced through the use of selective catalytic reduction (SCR).For older and smaller plants,low cost,low removal efficiency options such as selective non catalytic reduction (SNCR) and low NOx
