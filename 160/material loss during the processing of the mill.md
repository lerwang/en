26&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The process of prototyping a part to see if it can withstand the rigors of whatever process it will be used for is an old standby for many manufacturers.However,creating a physical prototype for any part requires much work to mill and tool—producing waste.Coping with Grief and LossHow to deal with the grieving process.While grieving a loss is an inevitable part of life,there are ways to help cope with the pain,come to terms with your grief,and eventually,find a way to pick up the pieces and move on with your life.
