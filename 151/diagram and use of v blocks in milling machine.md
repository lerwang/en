## What do you use 3 blocks for?
&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;I use them for spacing parts off of pins on the CNC table.That way I can leave the pins in and not worry about crashing into them with the cutter.They are also handy for spacing parts up off the table,or blocking in on the surface grinder.There are literally hundreds of uses for 3 blocks.Say you are setting up a part on an angle plate.CNC Machine Mechanical PartsThis is a 1 2&quot; 5 start and 10 TPI ACME precision lead screw that translates to 2 turns per inch.Use this to serve as your main mechanics to move an axis of your CNC machine.Couple this with our anti backlash nut with the same specifications.The quantity is priced per inch.Total length = quantity in inches.
