## Experimental Study of Electroplated Diamond Abrasive Belt …
Alumina ceramic material is very difficult to process and it is a typical hard to process material.and the abrasive is too fine,which cause the grinding efficiency low and debris accumulates.Therefore,120# # electroplated diamond abrasive belt is used for.Grinding ForceGrinding forces depend strongly on wheel grain sharpness.As grains become blunt,grinding forces increase.However,grains sometimes fracture and pull out,in which case,forces reduce with tool wear.This effect is particularly evident in grinding after fine dressing.
