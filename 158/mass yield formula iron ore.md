## How to do % percentage yield calculations how to calculate,
% yield calculation Example 142a (4) (a) Theoretically how much iron can be obtained from 1000 tonne of pure haematite ore,formula Fe 2 O 3 in a blast furnace? If we assume the iron(III) oxide ore (haematite) is reduced by carbon monoxide,the equation is: Fe 2,how do i calculate the mass percent of iron for the iron …&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Iron is mined from the earth as iron ore.Common ores include Fe2O3 (hematite),Fe3O4 (magnetite),and FeCo (siderite).I need help calculating the mass percent for each one of these please! Assume a g sample of each ore.Convert that amount to moles by.
