## Iron(III) oxide
Iron(III) oxide or ferric oxide is the inorganic compound with the formula Fe 2 O 3.It is one of the three main oxides of iron,the other two being iron(II) oxide (FeO),which is rare; and iron(II,III) oxide (Fe 3 O 4),which also occurs naturally as the mineral magnetite.GranufinGranufin&#174; begins with highly concentrated pigments that are turned into a liquid with high speed grinding equipment that coats individual pigment particles with color activating agents.The liquid is then sprayed into fine droplets and dried.
