## Metamorphism
Metamorphism is the change of minerals or geologic texture (distinct arrangement of minerals) in pre existing rocks (protoliths),without the protolith melting into liquid magma (a solid state change).[1] The change occurs primarily due to heat,pressure,and the introduction of chemically active fluids.The chemical components and crystal.Chapter 1The defects are the carriers of deformation,much as an electron or an ion is a carrier of charge.Just as the electric current depends on the density and velocity of the charge carriers,the shear strain rate,reflects the density and velocity of deformation

4.Deformation of K feldspar In response to the high pressure and low fluid activity during eclogite facies shearing,K feldspar did not undergo any phase transformations to phengitic micas but instead underwent plastic deformation and dynamic recrystallization.MyrmekiteMyrmekite describes a vermicular,or wormy,intergrowth of quartz in plagioclase.The intergrowths are microscopic in scale,typically with maximum dimensions less than 1 millimeter.The plagioclase is sodium rich,usually albite or oligoclase.These quartz plagioclase intergrowths are associated with and commonly in contact with potassium.
