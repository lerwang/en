## Environmental impact of iron ore mining Wikipedia
Introduction Iron ore Iron ore is rock containing enough iron content,and in sufficient volume and accessibility to mining and transportation to be able to be economically mined Iron in ore iron is most commonly found in the form of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4),hematite (Fe 2 O 3),goethite (FeO(OH)),limonite (FeO(OH)n(H 2 O)) or siderite (FeCO 3)Roughly 98% of iron ore on the,Airway inflammation in iron ore miners exposed to …The aim of the present study was to investigate if underground miners exposed to dust and diesel exhaust in an iron ore mine would show signs of airway inflammation as reflected in induced sputum.In total,22 miners were studied,once after a holiday of at least 2 weeks and the second time after 3 months of regular work.Control subjects were 21 “white collar” workers.
