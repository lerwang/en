## Sulfide minerals
The sulfide minerals are a class of minerals containing sulfide (S 2−) or persulfide (S 2 2−) as the major anion.Some sulfide minerals are economically important as metal ores.The sulfide class also includes the selenides,the tellurides,the arsenides,the antimonides,the bismuthinides,the sulfarsenides and the sulfosalts.Recovery of Gold in Pyritic Sulfide OresRecovery of gold in sulfide ores has fallen into several categories.First is froth flotation,and second is cyanidation of the ores.Using cyanide to recover gold from sulfide ores generally results in 30 to 35% recovery,

## Copper Mining and Processing: Processing of Copper Ores.
Copper processing is a complicated process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper called cathodes,which will ultimately be made into products for everyday use.The most common types of ore,copper oxide and copper sulfide,undergo two different processes,hyNUCLEAR CHEMICAL MINING OF PRIMARY SULFIDE …The ore consists of primary (hypogene) sulfide mineralization which has been oxidized near surface to form secondary (supergene) mineralization.A zone of secondary sulfide enrichment separates the sulfide and oxide ores.

## Zinc processing
The most common method for accomplishing this concentration is to isolate the sulfide mineral from the impure constituents,or gangue,by flotation separation.In this process,the ore initially is crushed to about 1.9 centimetres (0.75 inch),combined with water,and ground to less than 0.1 millimetre in a ball mill.milling copper sulfide oreAt present,although considerable leaching and direct smelting ores are produced,the bulk of the copper ore mined is concentrated.The milling of copper ores as practiced in the larger.differences in processing sulfide and oxide gold ores.Electrochemistry Encyclopedia — Extracting metals from sulfide ores in zinc sulfide processing.

Sulfide minerals The effluent from the tailings from the mining of sulfidic minerals has been described as &quot;the largest environmental liability of the mining industry&quot;.[2] These tailings contain large amounts of pyrite (FeS 2 ) and Iron(II) sulfide (FeS),which are rejected from the sought after ores of copper and nickel,as well as coal.Freeport McMoran Copper NYSE FCXnbsp 0183 32 Freeport McMoRan Inc FCX is a premier U S based natural resources company with headquarters in Phoenix Arizona FCX operates large long lived geographically diverse assets with significant proven and probable reserves of copper gold molybdenum cobalt

## How to Extract Precious Metals From Sulfides Sciencing
Precious metals can be found in ore deposits along with sulfur,and are known as sulfides.Cadmium,cobalt,copper,lead,molybdenum,nickel,silver,zinc,and gold and platinum group metals can be found in sulfide forms.These concentrated ore deposits are considered low grade because of the economic costs associated.Wading Through A Flooded Gold Mine To Find Goldnbsp 0183 32 Wading through a flooded gold mine to find gold Mine reportedly has free mill gold in quartz veins Mine and mine dump is on a gold bearing creek loaded with mineralized vuggy quartz and placer

## Zinc processing
Zinc processing Zinc processing Ores: Zinc ores are widely distributed throughout the world,although more than 40 percent of the world’s output originates in North America and Australia.The common zinc containing minerals are the zinc sulfide known as zinc blende or sphalerite (ZnS),a ferrous form of zinc blende known as marmatite [(ZnFe)S],and a zinc carbonate known as calamine or.Flotation of Copper Sulfide OresSome copper sulfide ores can be partially oxidized,also influencing the selection of a reagent scheme,with the exception being a hypogene sulfide copper ore.Copper sulfide ores are normally finer grained than porphyry copper ores and require finer grinding (i.e.70 80% 200 mesh).Flotation characteristics and treatment options The.
