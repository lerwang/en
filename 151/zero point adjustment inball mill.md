## CNC Skills: Origin Points — Part Two: Finding and setting.
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;In the first post in this CNC Skills series on Origin Points,I emphasized how critical reference positions are for digital woodworkers.When you’re working on a drawing in CAD,the origin point is at the intersection of the X,Y and Z axis.All measurements — positive or negative,begin at that point.Zero Return troubleshooting and setting home position on.NOTE: Remember switched machines after the initial zero return.Will not recalculate the zero return again unless the power is turned completely off at main breaker then back on.Only then it will recalculate the zero return.Also Keep in mind if you move switch or dog your zero return position will change and you may need to do a gridshift.
