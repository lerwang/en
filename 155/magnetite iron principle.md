## Why Is Iron the Best Core for an Electromagnet? Sciencing
However,iron has a relative permeability of 5,000 when it is 99.8 percent pure,and the relative permeability of soft iron with 99.95 percent purity is a massive 200,000.This huge relative permeability is why iron is the best core for an electromagnet.Ferromagnetism Georgia State UniversityFerromagnetism Iron,nickel,cobalt and some of the rare earths (gadolinium,dysprosium) exhibit a unique magnetic behavior which is called ferromagnetism because iron (ferrum in Latin) is the most common and most dramatic example.Samarium and neodymium in alloys with cobalt have been used to fabricate very strong rare earth magnets.

## Magnetite
Magnetite,ideal formula Fe 3 O 4,is an intriguing mineral,and not only because it is magnetic.The formula could be written as Fe 2+ Fe 3+ 2O 4,which more precisely designates one of its peculiarities.It contains both ferrous (Fe 2+) and ferric (Fe 3+) ions implying synthesis,growth,and stability within an environment where oxidized and reduced states of iron are present and maintained.Structures and magnetic properties of iron silicide from.1 Structures and magnetic properties of iron silicide from adaptive genetic algorithm and first principles calculations Zejin Yanga,b,Shunqing Wub,c,Xin Zhaob,Manh Cuong Nguyenb,Shu Yub,c,Tongqi Wenb,d,Ling Tanga,b,Fuxiang Lib,e,Kai Ming Hob and Cai Zhuang Wangb* a) School of Science,Zhejiang University of Technology,Hangzhou,310023,China
