## Beneficiation of Bauxite
BAUXITE deposits generally occur at or near the surface and are usually covered with shallow layer of overburden.The ore is almost invariably mined by open pit methods.The usual practice is to thoroughly strip and clear the overburden,after which the ore body is blasted to permit excavation by mechanical shovels.Some deposits contain highly siliceous clays and ferruginous materials distri.Beneficiation of High Aluminium Content Hematite …High aluminium content iron ore is one of typical intractable iron ores,and magnetic separation and floatation processes are found impracticable to remove alumina from the ore effectively.
