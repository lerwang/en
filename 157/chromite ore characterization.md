## Chromite: The only mineral ore of chromium metal
Chromite is important because it is the only economic ore of chromium,an essential element for a wide variety of metal,chemical,and manufactured products.Many other minerals contain chromium,but none of them are found in deposits that can be economically mined to produce chromium.Processing of Ferruginous Chromite Ore by Dry High.10&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;ABSTRACTMineral and morphological characteristics of chromite ore strongly affect the separation efficiency while upgrading the low grade deposits.Usually,chromite ore enrichment is carried out by using gravity separation due to high concentration criterion between chromite and other minerals.However,chromite ore from Sukinda region,India,is a typical ore body with high iron content in.
