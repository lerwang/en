Function: A cement mill is a drive used to grind the hard,nodular clinker from the cement kiln into the fine grey powder that is cement.Most cement is currently ground in ball mills and also vertical roller mills which are more effective than ball mills.Process: Raw materials are fed to the mill in right proportion with the help of weighfeeders.FUNdaMENTALS of Designball deflector,diverts the balls into a return tube that carries them back to the beginning of the nut’s thread.A leadscrew’ or ballscrew’s accuracy can be very great,because mul tiple thread turns can be simultaneously engaged which can help to average out.
