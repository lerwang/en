## Construction Waste Crusher Advantages of construction.
At present the country has been put into production of waste brick production line about 10,the scale of production from 30 million (standard brick),the annual ~ 150 million (standard brick) year,the total output l0 billion or so,only China Sintered clay brick production of 700 billion pieces of 1 700,so there is a huge development.How aluminum is madeIn 1886,two 22 year old scientists independently developed a smelting process that made economical mass production of aluminum possible.Known as the Hall Heroult process after its American and French inventors,the process is still the primary method of aluminum production today.

## Rod Mills
The fineness of grind and tonnage may be easily varied by altering the mill speed,rod charge or dilution.Under dry grinding conditions the rod mill product may be altered by varying tonnage,size of feed,size and quantity of grinding media and the use of peripheral discharge ports.Normally Rod Mills are furnished of the two trunnion design.Size reduction (GIKI)&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Another type of ball mill is used to an increasing extent,where the mill is vibrated instead of being rotated,and the rate of passage of material is controlled by the slope of the mill.• Grinding medium are the metalic balls are usually made of iron,manganes or steel and occupy between 30 and 50 per cent of the volume of the mill.
