## Creating Iron HowStuffWorks
Pig iron contains 4 to 5 percent carbon and is so hard and brittle that it's almost useless.If you want to do anything with it,you have three options.First,you can melt it,mix it with slag and hammer it out to eliminate most of the carbon (down to 0.3 percent) and.Steel Production American Iron and Steel InstituteThe blast furnace uses coke,iron ore and limestone to produce pig iron Coal is a key part of the coke making process The coal is crushed and ground into a powder and then charged into an oven where it is heated to approximately 1800&#176;F in the absence of oxygen
