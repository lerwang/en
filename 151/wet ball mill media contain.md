## Mechanical properties of wood plastic composites formed.
The objective of this study was to investigate the mechanical properties of wood plastic composites (WPCs) produced using wood flour (WF) prepared by wet ball milling under various milling times (0 120 min) and drying methods (freeze or heat drying).The drying method did not affect the particle size distribution,shape,or specific surface area of WF at milling times …Nanosuspension: An approach to enhance solubility …Since many years,nanosuspensions are prepared through wet grinding processes by using pearl ball mill.Nowadays,nanosuspensions can be prepared by dry milling methods.Stable nanosuspensions are prepared by using dry grinding of poorly soluble drug with soluble polymers and copolymers after dispersing in liquid medium.
