## WHAT ARE THE PROPERTIES OF AGGREGATES FOR CONCRETE.
 · Aggregates consisting of materials that can react with alkalies in cement and cause excessive expansion,cracking and deterioration of concrete mix should never be used.Therefore it is required to test aggregates to know whether there is presence of any such constituents in aggregate …ScreeningScreening is the separation of material into 2 6 different sized products.The material is separated by passing it through a vibrating 'screen box' which has a number of different sized screens,or meshes,which the material falls through like a seive.The material falls onto attached conveyors which stock pile the end products.The end.
