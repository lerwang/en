## Production costs of the non ferrous metals in the EU and,
The EU copper anodes industry was more competitive than Chile (417 EUR t Cu anode in 2013),comparable to Peru and China and less competitive than Zambia In the case of copper refineries,the European copper industry had much lower production costs than the countries from where most of imports of copper cathodes were originatingDual signal amplification strategy for high sensitivity.2&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;tunable dynamic range is more suitable for practical applica tions.For example,the reference value of CuT is 10.9 21.8 mM,while the CuEXC is 5 15% of the CuT,and the urinary copper (CuU) levels of patients with copper metabolic disorders are even more diverse depending on the de copper therapy.20 Thus,
