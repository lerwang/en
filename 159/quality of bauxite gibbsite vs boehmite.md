## Boehmite an overview ScienceDirect Topics
Bauxites are residually enriched rocks,mostly composed of Al hydroxides (gibbsite,boehmite and diaspore),kaolinite,Fe oxy hydroxides and Ti oxides (Fig 1),which formed from the intense lateritic weathering of aluminosilicate protolithsLateritic weathering and bauxite formation are generally favored by largely humid,tropical and subtropical climatComparison of Raman spectra in characterizing …High‐quality Raman spectra were used for the characterization of alumina phases of gibbsite,bayerite,diaspore and boehmite.The Raman spectrum of gibbsite shows four strong,sharp bands at 3617,3522,34 cm −1 in the hydroxyl stretching region.

## Phase Transformation of Minerals in Bauxite
In case of Gujarat bauxite,it is observed that at 400&#176; C phase conversion of alumogoethite to hematite with small amount of lepidocrocite occurred with unaccounted iron The important observation is that there is no significant phase transformation of gibbsite to boehmite diaspore as compared in Orissa and Jharkhand bauxitemining bauxite oreBauxite consists mostly of the aluminium minerals gibbsite,boehmite and diaspore,mixed with the two iron oxides goethite and haematite,the aluminium clay mineral kaolinite and small amounts of anatase and ilmenite.In 1821 the French geologist Pierre Berthier discovered bauxite near the village of Les Baux in Provence,southern France.

## Boehmite
19&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Boehmite occurs in tropical laterites and bauxites developed on alumino silicate bedrock.It also occurs as a hydrothermal alteration product of corundum and nepheline.It occurs with kaolinite,gibbsite and diaspore in bauxite deposits; and with nepheline,gibbsite,diaspore,natrolite and analcime in nepheline pegmatites.Probing the transformation paths from aluminum (oxy,of aluminum (oxy)hydroxides (ie,gibbsite and boehmite) in natural bauxite occurs at 200 300 &#176;C (eg,Kloprogge et al 2002),which corresponds to the temperature range of diagen esis Although it is difficult to identify the metastable Al 2 O 3 in natural bauxite due to their poor crystallinity,earlier studies have reported the presence.
