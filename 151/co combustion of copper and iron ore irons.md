## Characterization of Chemical Composition and.
The study aimed at investigating the chemical composition and microstructure of raw iron ore from the deposits in Muko area (south western Uganda).The quality of this iron ore was evaluated to establish its suitability to serve as a raw material for iron production.Samples were taken from the six hills of Muko ore deposits and tests carried out to establish their composition and properties.Safe carriage of Iron ore &amp; other iron concentrates in …25&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Safe carriage of Iron ore &amp; other iron concentrates in bulk Iron ore is used for the production of metallic iron in steel making.Although some 45 countries export natural iron ore resources,seven countries provide 75% of the total exported.The two largest exporters are Brazil and Australia,with about 33% of total world exports each.
