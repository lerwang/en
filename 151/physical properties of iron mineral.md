## Physical Characteristics of Minerals
The physical characteristics of minerals include traits which are used to identify and describe mineral species.These traits include color,streak,luster,density,hardness,cleavage,fracture,tenacity,and crystal habit.Certain wavelengths of light are reflected by the atoms of a mineral's crystal lattice while others are absorbed.Iron and steelMaking iron alloys or steel by one method or another will change the relative amounts of the ingredients,altering its properties.Treating steel in different ways after it's made changes its physical properties by altering its internal crystalline structure.

## Characterisation of the Physical and Metallurgical.
In summary,it is concluded that the Muko iron ore has good physical and metallurgical properties to serve as a natural material for the blast furnace and direct reduction furnaces.The blast furnace is still the dominant form of iron production,but over the years,direct reduction methods have increased due to a number of reasons.Marcasite Mineral Uses and Properties7&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Marcasite is a yellow to silvery yellow iron sulfide mineral with a chemical composition of FeS 2.It forms by precipitation from acidic waters in surface or near surface environments.Marcasite is commonly found in sediments,sedimentary rocks,and hydrothermal deposits in many parts of the world.
