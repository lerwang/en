## Machinability Study of Hardened 1045 Steel When Milling …
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Intermittent machining using ceramic tools such as hard milling is a challenging task due to the severe mechanical shock that the inserts undergo during machining and the brittleness of ceramic inserts.This study investigates the machinability of hardened steel.Milling Related PublicationsTool path strategy of milling process has a direct influence on the surface roughness and lead time of medical implant.High speed milling as promised process would improve the machined surface quality,but conventional or super abrasive grinding still required which imposes some drawbacks such as additional costs and time.
