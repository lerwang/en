4 Flotation is used to separate valuable minerals from waste rock or gangue,in which the ground ore is suspended in water and,after chemical treatment,subjected to bubbles of air.The minerals that are to be floated attach to the air bubbles,rise through the suspension,and are removed with the froth that forms on top of the pulp.IMPC 2014 Gecamin Digital PublicationsOnline proceedings.Welcome to IMPC 2014 online articles.This publication contains a selection of articles carefully reviewed by a technical committee composed of experts from the field.You can directly access the articles in this publication using the search box on the left.
