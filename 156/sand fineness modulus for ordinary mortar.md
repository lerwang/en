## Effect of Fineness Modulus of Manufactured Sand on Mechanical …
mortar [8,5].It is pointed out that manufactured sand is anytime better than river sand.The particle shape is cubical,which is almost closer to rounded river sand.Another issue associated with river sand is that of obtaining required grading with a finenessFineness ModulusThe bigger the fineness modulus is,the more coarse the sand is.The fineness modulus of the sand used in ordinary concrete is within 3.7 ~ 1.6.And if M x is within 3.7 ~ 3.1,it is coarse sand; if M x is within 3.0 ~ 2.3,it is medium sand; if M x is within 2.2 ~ 1.6,it is fine sand; and if M x is within 1.0.7,it is superfine sand which should be considered specifically when concrete is.
