## Lime (material)
Lime is a calcium containing inorganic mineral composed primarily of oxides,and hydroxide,usually calcium oxide and or calcium hydroxide.It is also the name for calcium oxide which occurs as a product of coal seam fires and in altered limestone xenoliths in volcanic ejecta.[1] The word lime originates with its earliest use as building.limestone Characteristics,Uses,&amp; Facts BritannicaLimestone has two origins: (1) biogenic precipitation from seawater,the primary agents being lime secreting organisms and foraminifera; and (2) mechanical transport and deposition of preexisting limestones,forming clastic deposits.Travertine,tufa,caliche,chalk,sparite,and micrite are all varieties of limestone.
