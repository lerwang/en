## Analysis and validation of a run of mine ore grinding mill.
Two types of mills commonly found in the minerals pro cessing industry are ball and semi autogenous (SAG) mills,which use both ore and steel balls as grinding media (Wei and Craig,2009b).In the case of a ball mill the ore is crushed before it enters the mill,whereas a SAG mill re ceives run of mine (ROM) ore directly (Stanley,1987).Amineral ore grinding mills in sudangrinding in ore dressing ball trap planete hte ndie.fr.rock grinding ball mill for ore dressing process.Ore Grinding Mills are used for the fine grinding as the last step in the reduction of an.or,as in South Africa,a mixed steel ball and rock load.of the testing procedure of the Dorr Company at the Westport,Conn.laboratories.of wh

## Autogenous and Semi Autogenous Mills
AG SAG mills are normally used to grind run offmine ore or primary crusher product.Feed size to the mill is limited to that size which can be practically conveyed and introduced into the mill.The mill product can either be finished size ready for processing,or an intermediate size ready for final grinding in a ball mill,pebble mill,orFine grinding of industrial minerals&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Fine grinding is a process stage that is necessary for all industrial minerals,some of which have to be ground to the submicron range.The following contribution provides an overview of the important industrial minerals,their manufacturing processes,the fineness requirements and the processes employed for dry and wet grinding.
