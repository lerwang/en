## Chemically bound water as measure of degree of …
chemically bound water is assumed to be lost at heating to +105 &#186;C.The degree of hydration is therefore determined by weighing the sample after drying to +105 &#186;C and after ignition to 1000 &#186;C.The weight difference corresponds to the chemically bound water content.GYPSUM BOARD WITH IMPROVED STARCH BINDER25&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;GYPSUM BOARD WITH IMPROVED STARCH BINDER.United States Patent Applicat75482.(free water) is evaporated from the gypsum core while the chemically bound water is retained in the newly formed gypsum crystals.FIG.1 is a data plot of temperature and viscosity of conventional,low thinning,medium thinning and high thinning.

## Experimental studies of gypsum plasterboards.
Gypsum contains approximately 21% by weight chemically bound water of crystallization and about 79% calcium sulfate,which is inert below a temperature of 1200 &#176;C.In addition to the water of crystallization,up to 4% free water is also present inside gypsum,depending upon the ambient temperature …Gypsum CalcinationCalcination is the practice of dehydrating gypsum into plaster or stucco through a batch or continuous process which includes heating the gypsum to evaporate the crystalline water.Typically,free water is removed in an initial process at approximately 45℃ and crystalline bound water is removed in a second process at 180℃.
