2018 12 18&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;example,copper sulphate acts as an activator for the flotation of sphalerite using xanthate as a collector at relatively low concentration.Copper ion exchanges for zinc ion of the mineral surface,and the sphalerite particle then behaves in flotation like a copper sulphide particle.DepressantsUse of chelating agents as collectors in the flotation of …Fourteen reagents that are potentially capable of chelating with a metal ion on the surface of the major copper sulfide minerals and pyrite were evaluated for their effectiveness in floating these sulfides.The reagents studied fall into the classes of mercaptobenzole.
