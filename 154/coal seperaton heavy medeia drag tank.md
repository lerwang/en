## Coal preparation plant
A coal preparation plant (CPP; also known as a coal handling and preparation plant (CHPP),coal handling plant,prep plant,tipple or wash plant) is a facility that washes coal of soil and rock,crushes it into graded sized chunks (sorting),stockpiles grades preparing it for transport to market,and more often than not,also loads coal into rail cars,barges,or ships.heavy media gravity separationHeavy Media Gravity Separation Heavy media gravity separation involves using a mixture of fine media material,such as magnetite (SG 51) or ferrosilicon (SG 68),suspended in a slurry of water,to produce a media slurry with a specific gravity that will allow low density material(s) to float,and other high density material(s) to sink

Oct 10,2018&#0183;&#32;The mechanism of density segregation in the heavy medium flow field for wide grained coal was observed The effects of various parameters,such as the feeding position,the feed flow rate,and the amount of feed for shallow tank heavy media separation were investigatedGlobal Coal &amp; Mining Pvt.Ltd.The heavy media plant consists of two major sections H.M Bath section and fine coal section with other associated sections for Media handling,de watering,Stocking etc.H.M Bath Section mm to +6mm will be the feed to the Heavy Media Circuit from the present screening plant,for which provision has already been made.

## Cyclones
Therefore operating the cyclones at high feed % solids will reduce separation efficiency and result in a coarser overflow,as the drag force is increased on each particle causing the particles to remain nearer the centre.The cyclones should ideally be operated atCPC Scheme B03B SEPARATING SOLID MATERIALS USING LIQUIDS,SEPARATING SOLID MATERIALS USING LIQUIDS OR USING PNEUMATIC TABLES OR JIGS,Separating by pneumatic tables or by pneumatic jigs (sink float separation using dry heavy media B03B 5 46) [2016 05] NOTE,eg slime tanks (using shaken.
