## Losses in the coal supply chain
1 Introduction Losses in the coal supply chain 5 According to IEA (2012) data,global coal production has almost doubled since the 1980s,from less than 4 Gt in the 1980s to 7.6 Gt in 2011 (IEA,2012).This growth has come from the rise in both thermal coal forAnalysis of CoalCoal Analysis techniques are specific analytical methods designed to measure the particular physical and chemical properties of coals.There are two methods to analyze coal which are called proximate analysis and ultimate analysis.The proximate analysis determines only the fixed carbon,volatile matter,moisture and ash percentages and it can be determined with a simple apparatus.

Moisture content is an important parameter in coal analysis.It is needed for determining the calorific (heating) value and handling properties of a coal.The moisture value given for a proximate analysis is the moisture measured as mass lost from a sample under specified conditions after heating in a moisture oven to 104 to 110 C (ASTM method D 11; American Society for Testing and.Types and Composition of CoalWhile &quot;coal&quot; is often described as a single commodity,in fact coal varies widely in important physical characteristics such as energy content (usually measured in British Thermal Units,BTU ),carbon percentage,moisture content,presence of contaminants such as sulfur,etc.
