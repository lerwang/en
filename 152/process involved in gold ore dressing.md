## Mineral processing metallurgy Britannica
8&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Mineral processing,art of treating crude ores and mineral products in order to separate the valuable minerals from the waste rock,or gangue.It is the first process that most ores undergo after mining in order to provide a more concentrated material for the procedures of extractive metallurgy.Galena Lead Ore Processing15&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Galena Lead Ore Processing.Galena is kind of lead mineral with big density 7.7.6g cm3 and gangue density of 2.3g cm3.Its big embedded granule and density difference makes gravity a great beneficiation method to gain high grade galena concentrate.For gravity separation of galena,the separator involved is mainly jigger.
