The main differences between hydrated lime and quicklime are their reactivity &amp; their chemical composition.Hydrated lime and quicklime are both calcium compounds.In its hydrated state,calcium is called calcium hydroxide,and in its pure state it is called calcium oxide,or quicklime.Calcium oxide has a heavy density (65lb ft&#179;) and is more reactive than hydrated lime.sand filter machine in coimbatoresand filter machines in tamilnadu.With the development of Tamilnadu based construction peak arrival,aggregate demand for industrial space will be more vast.But the market sand in high demand,then there is artificial sand.Artificial sand is also called the mechanism of sand,rocks and gravel is put through the treatment of sand making
