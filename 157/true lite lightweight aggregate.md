## Lightweight Aggregate Concrete Properties,Uses and,
The less weight of light weight concrete is due to the usage of fine and course lightweight aggregate When the complete aggregate is replaced with lightweight aggregate,the weight decreases the concrete density of by approx 10 kilogram per cubic meter For Example,1 square foot of 15 inch thick normal concrete weighs about 18 poundsThe Pumice Store: Lightweight Concrete AggregateLightweight Aggregate PUMICE CONCRETE is composed of Portland cement,pumice stones,pumice sand,pumice powder (pozzolan),and water Compared to standard concrete,pumice concrete offers roughly a one third reduction in weight and four times the r value Proportioning,mixing and placing are done in a similar manner to that of standard concrete
