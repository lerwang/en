Uniaxial compressive strength The uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) is one of the most frequently quoted properties in rock engineering,used in design,analysis and modelling.It is regarded as the highest stress that a rock specimen can carry when a unidirectional stress is applied,normally in an axial direction to the ends of a.Usability of Crystalline Basement Rocks as Construction.9&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;migmatite has the highest uniaxial compressive strength (12.77N mm2),and the micaceous quartzite has the minimum uniaxial compressive strength (2.85N mm2).Other rocks in the area such as porphyritic granite,granite gneiss and mica schist have uniaxial compressive strength of 3.11N mm2,5.68 N mm2 and 3.13N mm2 respectively.

Backfill is commonly used in underground mines.The quality control of the backfill is a key step to ensure it meets the designed strength requirement.This is done through sample collection from the underground environment,followed by uniaxial compression tests to obtain the Uniaxial Compressive Strength (UCS) in the laboratory.When the cylindrical cemented backfill samples are axially.27&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;These equations relate the penetration rate with intact rock parameters like the uniaxial compressive strength [12,13],the rock tensile strength [14] or the rock fracture toughness [15],showing good predictive ability in the case of homogenous 1609 02
