## Gold Leaching from Waste Printed Circuit Board by Iodine.
A new approach for leaching gold from waste printed circuit board(PCB) by iodine process is investigated.The rational parameters for iodine leaching gold from waste PCB are 1.0%~1.2% iodine concentration,n(I2).Gold Ore Processing ScienceDirectGold roasting is a process,applicable to refractory ores and concentrates that contain sulfide sulfur,organic carbon,and potentially arsenic.Removal of these compounds is necessary to achieve high gold recovery (&gt;90%) during cyanide leaching.Gold roasting is typically a metallurgical fluidized bed process.
