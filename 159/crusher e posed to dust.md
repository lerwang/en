## Construction dust: respirable crystalline silica.
Queensland's construction industry has one of the largest groups of silica exposed workers in the state,and just because it has been a risk to workers for a long time does not mean it can be ignored.Silica can lead to lung diseases such as silicosis,lung cancer,obstructive lung disease,bronchitis,asthma and loss of respiratory volume.Guidance about dusts and other airborne contaminantsDust needs to be effectively controlled at each crusher,mill and grinder,with dust control appliances fitted at the primary crusher feed hopper as well as secondary and tertiary crushers plus screens.Conveyor belt transfer points and stockpile tunnels may also require dust control measures.

## How to Control Dust
Good dust control and good process control are not mutually exclusive.Good operating practice can minimize dust and maximize production.Examples: • Choke Feed Crushers pushing more stone through a crusher means moving less air and results in less dust.This is especially true of impact crushers and hammermills.IJERPH Free Full Text Platinum Mine Workers’ Exposure …The South African mining industry is one of the largest producers of platinum (Pt) in the world.Workers in this industry are exposed to significant amounts of dust,and this dust consists of particles sizes that can penetrate deep inside the respiratory region.A cross sectional study was conducted to evaluate dust exposure risk at two Pt mine waste rock crusher plants (Facility A and B) in.
