## A killer combination for ideal grinding conditions.
The grinding ratio significantly improved when the abrasive was changed from conventional aluminum oxide to MSB,and then doubled again when the fluid was changed to Quantalube 270.Normally,when an MSB wheel replaces a conventional grinding one,wheel performance significantly improves while energy requirements increase.Sizing Method Based on Grinding Ratio in Heavy Grinding19&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Grinding ratio is widely known as the volume ratio of a material removed to a wheel wear.Therefore grinding wheel wear is generated by the product of grinding ratio and volume of material removed.Assuming that the grinding ratio is a constant,it can easily calculate the radial wheel wear caused by removing the grinding allowance of workpiece.

## GRINDING PARAMETERS CONVERSION CALCULATOR
CALCULATING SFPM The performance of grinding wheels and quality of the finished workpiece is affected by how fast the abrasive grains sweep over the workpiece.That speed affects surface quality,workpiece burn,material removal rates,and other factors.Since the speed of the abrasives on the wheel perimeter depends upon the diameter of the wheel,RPM isn't a useful measure.Form crush dressing of diamond grinding wheels ScienceDirectThe main characteristic of crushing is that the tool and the grinding wheel should have exactly the same circumferential speed,i.e.a speed ratio q d = 1.This will avoid a relative velocity between the two bodies,resulting in lower wear of the profiling tool.Contrary to profile crushing the crushing speed v sd in form crushing is about 10 times higher to create an acceptable profiling time.

## What is grinding ratio (G)
The grinding ratio is defined as the ratio of the volume of material required to the volume of wheel wear G = (the volume of material required) (the volume of wheel wear) The value of grinding ratio is usually about 10 to 60 for fine grinding operations like horizontal surface grinding. Whereas,for rough grinding operation,the value.EFFECT OF DRESSING OVERLAP RATIO ON THE …14&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;grinding wheel decreases.The traverse rate increases when the overlap ratio is decreased,resulting in a sharp and open grinding wheel face and coarser finish on the work piece.Figure 4 is a diagram illustrating the effect of adjusting the overlap ratio on the grinding wheel face.
