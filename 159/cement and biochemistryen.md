Abstract Cement production is currently the largest single industrial emitter of CO 2,accounting for ∼8% (2.8 Gtons y) of global CO 2 emissions.Deep decarbonization of cement manufacturing will require remediation of both the CO 2 emissions due to the decomposition of CaCO 3 to CaO and that due to combustion of fossil fuels (primarily coal) in calcining (∼900 C) and sintering (∼1,450 C).Vertebroplasty by Use of a Strontium Containing Bioactive …Study Design.A review of the laboratory and clinical data for a new strontium containing hydroxyapatite bioactive bone cement.Objectives.To compare the properties of the strontium containing bioactive bone cement with those of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA
