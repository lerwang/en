## Ball Mill Grinding Theory
The total feed to the ball mill was therefore 11.54 T.per hr.or 179 per cent,of the original feed.It was evident that the ball mill was greatly underloaded in this test,but so much trouble developed in the classifier,due to the tendency of the sands to slip down the slopes,that a more rapid feed was not attempted at this time.The working principle of ball millThe ball mill consists of a metal cylinder and a ball.The working principle is that when the cylinder is rotated,the grinding body (ball) and the object to be polished (material) installed in the cylinder are rotated by the cylinder under the action of friction and centrifugal force.
