## Cone crusher by SIEBTECHNIK TEMA.Crushing &amp; milling equipment
Cone crusher.Cone crushers,slow operation size reduction machines,are perfectly suited to produce cubic particle or to reduce heat sensitive materials or very hard materials (such as corundum,ferrous Silicium,ore iron ores).Cone Crushers&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Cone crushers are used in AG and SAG grinding circuits to increase tonnage by effectively dealing with any pebble (critical size) build up problem.Normally,heavy duty short head crushers are employed to crush pebbles.Power and crusher cavity level are the key variables for monitoring and controlling the crusher operation.
