The widest distance is known as the open side setting (OSS) and the narrowest,the closed side setting (CSS).These settings are important.The OSS is the largest distance between the concave and the mantle at the bottom of the crusher,so it determines the largest particle size of the outgoing product.the CSS is the final crushing zone.CrushersAn additional crushing effect occurs between the compressed particles,resulting in less wear of the liners.This is called interparticular crushing also.The cone crushers are equipped with a hydraulic setting adjustment system,which adjusts closed side setting and thus affects product gradation.

## 11 tips for maximizing cone crusher productivity.
An example of the effect that crusher setting has on the product gradation is as follows: If the target crusher setting is 3 8 in.(10 mm) but the setting is not checked and it wears open to 1 2 in.(13 mm),then the end result is a 15 percent decrease in the minus 3 in.(10 mm) material size.This is a substantial decrease in productivity.Prediction Model for Liner Wear Considering the …Thus a mathematical model of liner wear is necessary to predict the state of liner.Lindqvist developed a wear model which considered the effect of normal pressure and shear forces.The pressure is related to structural parameters of the crushing chamber such as closed side setting (CSS) and eccentric angle.
