## INTRODUCTION TO ASPHALT EMULSIONS
Asphalt droplets in an emulsion have the surface active emulsifier oriented at their surface.The emulsifier attaches itself to the interface in the colloid mill as soon as mechanical shearing forces of the mill expose the new asphalt surfaces.From that time on theAsphalt Emulsion MillsAsphalt Emulsion Mills.Our latest mill for asphalt emulsion production broadens the range of asphalt that can be successfully emulsified and improves the stability and quality of the emulsion.Tests were performed all over the world on multiple grades of asphal

## Asphalt Emulsion
Asphalt Emulsion.Asphalt emulsions are mixtures of asphalt,water,and specific chemical additives (surfactants) that allow the other two materials to be blended into a stable liquid—the same principle is used in the recovery of heavy oil or tar sand bitumen by the use of surfactants (Speight,2008,2009,2014).
