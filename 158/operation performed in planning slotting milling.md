## Milling and Milling Operations Smithy
Milling is the process of machining flat,curved,or irregular surfaces by feeding the workpiece against a rotating cutter containing a number of cutting edges.The milling machine consists basically of a motor driven spindle,which mounts and revolves the milling cutter,and a reciprocating adjustable worktable,which mounts and feeds the workpiece.Milling Machine: Methods of Milling.Milling ProcessesMilling is an important process of manufacturing technology and basically it refers to the removal of metal from the work piece using a tool which has several cutting points and is rotating about its axis.Thus each cutting point removes a little bit of the metal but since.
