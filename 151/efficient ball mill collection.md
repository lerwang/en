## Optimization of mill performance by using
Optimization of mill performance by using online ball and pulp measurements by B.Clermont* and B.de Haas* Synopsis Ball mills are usually the largest consumers of energy within a mineral concentrator.Comminution is responsible for 50% of the total mineral processing cost.In today‚Äôs global markets,expanding mining groups are tryingThedetermination oftheefficiencyofthe millingprocessJowetP isaccepted,then ball milling isabout 80per centefficient.CONCLUSIONS It has been shown that ball milling isarelatively efficient process when compared with allother known comminution processes.There would seem tobesome evidence to support the validity of the proposal of JowetP that the standard of 100per cent efficiency

## Size Reduction
Size reduction in impact crushers occurs through particle concussion by rigid forces.The hammer crusher,also called the hammer mill,is an example of an impact crusher.In hammer crushers,hammers swing freely on a disc mounted on the main shaft within the device.Factors Affecting Ball Mill Grinding EfficiencyThe following are factors that have been investigated and applied in conventional ball milling in order to maximize grinding efficiency: a) Mill Geometry and Speed Bond (1954) observed grinding efficiency to be a function of ball mill diameter,and established empirical relationships for recommended m
