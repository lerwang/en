## Milling (machining)
Milling is the process of machining using rotary cutters to remove material[1] by advancing a cutter into a work piece.This may be done varying direction[2] on one or several axes,cutter head speed,and pressure.[3] Milling covers a wide variety of different operations and machines,on scales from small individual parts to large,heavy duty.For every requirement the best milling solution.11 For every requirement the best milling solution.We have always offered technologies for processing of classical grains,such as wheat,durum wheat,corn or oats.In addition,we process rye,buckwheat,barley,spelt,sorghum,soy,and pulses.Processes for the
