## Ore processing Waihi Gold
Ore is stockpiled (1) at the processing plant,and the process begins by feeding the ore into a hopper with a loader.The ore is conveyed,and lime is added (2) to raise the pH of the ore.Following crushing through a jaw crusher (3),the ore is fed into the semi autogenous grinding (SAG) mill (4) …Gold Processing,Extraction,Smelting Plant Design.Gold ore.Prominer maintains a team of senior gold processing engineers with expertise and global experience.These gold professionals are specifically in gold processing through various beneficiation technologies,for gold ore of different characteristics,such as flotation,cyanide leaching,gravity separation,etc.to achieve the processing plant of optimal and cost efficient process designs.
