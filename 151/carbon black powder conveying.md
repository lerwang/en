## Carbon Black: Successful Handling and Transportation.
Carbon black is an inorganic,colloidal material produced by the incomplete combustion of petroleum products like natural gas.Also known as lamp black,furnace black,and gas black,carbon black is manufactured by a combustion process whereby a flame touches a cool surface,leaving a black residue,which is then collected as carbon black.China Carbon Black Pneumatic Conveying Equipment Automatic,Powder scale weighing accuracy: Static≤&#177;01% FS,dynamic≤&#177;02% FS Weighing cycle time: ≤90 120s batch: Carbon black pneumatic conveying capacity: 3 15t h: Oil injection pressure: 2 6 Mpa: Oil conveying temperature: 0 85ºC: Processing oil injection,carbon black and major ingredients discharging cycle time: ≤20s
