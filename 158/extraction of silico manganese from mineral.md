## Eramet Activities Explore & Produce: from extaction to,
From manganese to nickel,mineral sands and soon lithium,and from preliminary engineering studies to processing extracted ore,we handle every stage in the process of crafting a finished product that's ready to be incorporated into alloys or converted into partsEffect of Manganese on Silver LeachingIn Mexico and elsewhere there are large bodies of valuable silver ore containing manganese which present great,and hitherto insuperable,obstacles to a satisfactory extraction by cyanide The proportion of the silver that is soluble in cyanide varies greatly and may be as low as 5% only The mere presence of manganese in the ore is not invariably accompanied by refractoriness of the silver.
