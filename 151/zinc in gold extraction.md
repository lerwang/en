## Development of a hydrometallurgical.
In order to recover gold and silver from anode slimes containing Cu,Ni,Sn,and Zn,an integrated hydrometallurgical process consisting of leaching,solvent extraction,and cementation was developed.All the metals together with 10% of Ag(I) were dissolved by the mixture of HCl and H2O2 at the optimum conditions.Separation of Au (III) together with Sn (II) was performed by Cyanex 272 from.Gold Extraction Mining Gold.info18&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The acid detaches the gold from the rock dust and transports it in the acid seepage fluid in a chemically bound form.Subsequently,the gold is filtered out of the leach solution by adding zinc dust.then washed out of the muddy substrate and finally dried.The recovered raw gold is later refined into fine gold.
