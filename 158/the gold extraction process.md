## How gold is made history,used,parts,procedure,
Once extracted,the gold is refined with one of four main processes: floatation,amalgamation,cyanidation,or carbon in pulp Each process relies on the initial grinding of the gold ore,and more than one process may be used on the same batch of gold ore MiningProcessing,smelting and refining gold World Gold CouncilThe two gold refining methods most commonly employed to derive pure gold are: the Miller process and the Wohlwill process The Miller process uses gaseous chlorine to extract impurities when gold is at melting point; impurities separate into a layer on the surface of the molten purified gold
