## Gold cyanidation
Gold cyanidation (also known as the cyanide process or the MacArthur Forrest process) is a hydrometallurgical technique for extracting gold from low grade ore by converting the gold to a water soluble coordination complex.It is the most commonly used leaching process for gold extraction.Cyanide Waihi GoldReports and Plans; Community Updates; Project Martha; Contact; Waihi Gold Mining Cyanide,pH and acid drainage,and the many myths and misconceptions relating to cyanide The cyanide process of gold recovery enabled a higher percentage of gold and silver to be extracted from hard rock,making many operations viable that would,

## Should cyanide still be used in modern day mining,
After several high profile leaks and spills,the use of cyanide in mining operations is facing increasing public opposition with some countries banning it completely The toxic chemical is still widely used for the processing of certain ores,most notably gold,but should cyanide be phased out of.Gold ExtractionGold Extraction Process,expanded gravity circuit and additional leach tanks to cater for increased gold output in the future There are plans to in future crush and use autosorters underground in the mines to remove the waste rock that dilutes the ore This has the potential to lift ore grades to 20g t and therefore the process plant.

## Process of Cyanide Gold Extraction
Here I present an Process EXAMPLE of Gold Extraction Cyanide in which the cyanidation feed consists of a pyrite concentrate floated after the selective flotation of a copper gold concentrate The pyrite concentrate is reground to 90% minus 325 mesh and aerated in a high lime solution prior to cyanidation It contains 99% sulphides of which 10 to 20 percent is pyrrhotite and 03,Third Transition Series: Extraction of Gold Occurrence …&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Extraction from Gold Ores Mac Arthur Forrest Cyanide Process.The extraction of gold from the sulphide or telluride ore involves the following steps : i) Crushing,grinding and concentration
