## Bioleaching of copper ore flotation concentrates
The bioleaching of flotation concentrate is a new method for copper recovery that could form the basis of an economic and environmentally friendly process.The main objective of this work was to evaluate a bioleaching process from the treatment of two.COPPER Copper productioncleaned in several flotation steps.After sedimentation in thickeners and filtration in automatic filter presses or vacuum filters (ceramic disk) the typical copper concentrate contains 25 35 % Cu and about 8 % moisture.The moisture content of the concentrate is a

## Calcite Processing by Flotation for Beneficiation
The Problem with Calcite Processing &amp; Flotation The availability of high lime rock is often limited and it becomes necessary to use lower grade sources from quarries favorably located to cement plants.Beneficiation of the lime rock in such cases is necessary to remove impurities and to secure the proper ratio of calcite to other constituents for cement specifications.Production LineDolomite Mining Process Dolomite mining process is the solution of separating dolomite concentrate from Dolomite raw ore.Based on mosaic structure of the Dolomite mine and years of mining process experiences,Xinhai applying Dolomite mining process of two stage crushing,washing,then three stage separating,flotation process will be used to process Dolomite with complex structures.
