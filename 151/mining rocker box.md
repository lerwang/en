## Rocker box
A rocker box (also known as a cradle) is a gold mining implement for separating alluvial placer gold from sand and gravel which was used in placer mining in the 19th century.It consists of a high sided box,which is open on one end and on top,and was placed on rockers.The inside bottom of the box is lined with riffles and usually a carpet (called Miner's Moss) similar to a sluice.Rocker Boxes Used by the Gold MinersThe rocker box,or &quot;cradle,&quot; was a popular tool used by miners during the early gold rushes.They were portable devices that were able to capture much more than just a gold pan alone.Their design was relatively simple.Rather than using an active flow like a sluice,water was fed into the head of the rocker box manually using a tin can.
