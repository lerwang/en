## Copper Ore
Copper ore usually contains about 0.5 to 2% copper that occurs in the form of disseminated and stringers.The run of mine ore is reduced from 150 mm to 25 mm size in Jaw and Cone crushers.The crushed ore is grinded in ball mills to −74 μm size.The ore is processed by froth flotation comprising rougher and scavenger cells.Copper extraction14&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Copper extraction refers to the methods used to obtain copper from its ores.The conversion of copper consists of a series of physical and electrochemical processes.Methods have evolved and vary with country depending on the ore source,local environmental regulations,and other factors.As in all mining operations,the ore must usually be.
