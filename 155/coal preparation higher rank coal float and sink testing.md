## Coal assay
Coal classification by rank Several international standards classify coals by their rank,where increasing rank corresponds to coal with a higher carbon content.The rank of coal is correlated with its geologic history,as described in Hilt's law.ISO 2:2004(en),Hard coal ? Froth flotation testing ? …The froth flotation of coal has a widespread application for the recovery of fine coal particles and their separation from unwanted mineral matter.The response of coal to the froth flotation process is measured initially by a laboratory scale test.ISO 1:1990 provides a means of evaluating the general flotation characteristics of a coal under a set of specified conditions and will not.

## Coal Beneficiation
Coal preparation,or beneficiation,is a series of operations that remove mineral matter (i.e.ash) from coal.Preparation relies on different mechanical operations,which will not be discussed in detail,to perform the separation,such as size reduction,size classification,cleaning,dewatering and drying,waste disposal,and pollution control.Beryllium Content of American CoalsBERYLLIUM CONTENT OF AMERICAN COALS 255 high values for some of these elements in coal are a result of this type of accumulation.Zilbermintz and Rusanov (1936) spectrographically determined the beryllium content of 602 coal samples
