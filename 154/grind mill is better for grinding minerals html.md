## Grinding Mills
Grinding in small plants,as in larger installations,has proven to be the most costly of all unit operations from both capital and operating standpoints.Therefore,grinding deserves the most scrutiny of all operations during the design procedure.A recent survey by a major grinding mill manufacturer reveals that more than 80 autogenous or semi autogenous mills having between 100 and 1,000.Scats production in overflow ball millYou forgot ignored the full recipe prescription.That 100 mm ball needs to be eliminated and your low ball charge (mill power draw) must be increased.You must change those first.Just letting the &lt;15 mm scats back into the mill (larger trommel holes) will not magically make them get ground without more properly sized grinding media.
