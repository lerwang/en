## Sharpening Stone Grit Chart
Our Sharpening Stone Grit Chart After discussing the topic of grit coarseness and fineness we decided to come up with our own chart.Since one person's &quot;fine&quot; and one manufacturers &quot;fine&quot; may mean something completely different we established a 1 to 10 grit chart with 1 being the most coarse and 10 being the most fine.SiltSilt is granular material of a size between sand and clay,whose mineral origin is quartz and feldspar.Silt may occur as a soil (often mixed with sand or clay) or as sediment mixed in suspension with water (also known as a suspended load) and soil in a body of water such as a river.such as a river.

## Gradation and Size
The particle size distribution,or gradation,of an aggregate is one of the most influential aggregate characteristics in determining how it will perform as a pavement material.In HMA,gradation helps determine almost every important property including stiffness,stability,durability,permeability,workability,fatigue resistance,frictional resistance and moisture susceptibility (Roberts et.Tub Grinders 101Tub grinders are aptly named for the distinctive infeed hopper which is simply a large round tub,normally 10’ ’ in diameter and roughly 6' deep.Production rates and capability of the tub grinder vary primarily with the weight,horsepower and size of the tub grinder.

Particle size distribution is the number of particles that fall into each of the various size ranges given as a percentage of the total number of all sizes in the sample of interest.A particle size analyzer is being used to measure particle size of particles.Usually we use.Particle size distributionThe particle size distribution (PSD) of a powder,or granular material,or particles dispersed in fluid,is a list of values or a mathematical function that defines the relative amount,typically by mass,of particles present according to size.[1] Significant energy is usually required to disintegrate soil,etc.particles into the PSD that is.
