## Is It Cost Effective to Replace Old Eddy Current Drives?
The drive efficiency at each operating point is equal to 100% minus the percent losses.Table 1 indicates the efficiency range of a magnetically coupled eddy current drive when matched to a centrifugal load.Energy Savings Example.An eddy current drive on a standard efficiency motor driven 50 hp boiler forced draft fan hasSteel Pipe Hydraulic Test VS Eddy Current TestingHowever,this method has a large area,high energy consumption and low efficiency.Most of the early eddy current testing uses the wave height comparison method,that is,only the magnitude of the detected eddy current signal is used to judge whether the steel tube has defects.
