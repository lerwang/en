## material incline shaft
Slope mining is a method of accessing valuable geological material,such as coal or ore.A sloping access shaft travels downwards towards desired material.Slope mines differ from shaft and drift mines,which access resources by tunneling straight down or horizontally,respectively.In slope mining,the primary access to the mine is on an incline.Angle of Repose&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The angle produced by the powder on the surface is the angle of repose.The other way is to allow powder from a central hole of a flat bottomed container.The slope produced by the remaining powder in the container bottom is the angle of repose.Furthermore,rotating drum can be used to measure the angle of repose.

## Hopper Design Principles
δ.φ.Jenike [1] found that the hopper angle required to allow flow along the walls depends on the friction between the powder and the walls,the friction between powder particles,and the geometry of the hopper.Design charts originally developed by Jenike [1] provide allowable hopper angles for mass flow,given values of the wall friction angle and the effective angle of internal friction.Geotechnical Engineering28&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;GEOTECHNICAL ENGINEERING HIGHWAY DESIGN &amp; CONSTRUCTION Geotechnical Aspects of Highway Design Related Centers FOR HIGHWAY DESIGN,CONSTRUCTION,ETC.SEE THE CIVIL ENGINEERING CENTER Geotechnical Engineering Courses,Technical Reports,Software,etc.
