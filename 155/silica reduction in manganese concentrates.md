## Mineral Concentrate Marketing Treatment Charges & Penalties
12 03 2016&#0183;&#32;Manganese is considered equivalent to iron,but is rarely present in concentrat The silica penalty is expressed as insoluble Since the insoluble determination is less expensive for both the shipper and the smelter,and since the small amount of other elements,principally alumina,which are included in the insoluble are also detrimental,the insoluble is on the whole a perfectly fair basis.
