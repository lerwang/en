## Inherent Factors Affecting Bulk Density and Available Water Capacity
Inherent Factors Affecting Bulk Density and Available Water Capacity Inherent factors that affect bulk density such as soil texture cannot be changed.Bulk density is dependent on soil organic matter,soil texture,the density of soil mineral (sand,silt,and clayLime to Kill Moss HunkerLime,and more particularly agricultural or dolomitic lime,raises the pH of soil.By raising the pH level of soil,these types of limes make soil less acidic.Many moss species prefer acidic soil while turf grass flourishes in neutral soil.Thus when applied to soil,lime.

## The Benefits and Effects of Limestone Sciencing
Limestone works as an amendment to soils and lawns to increase alkalinity.Acid loving plants like camellias,azaleas,blueberries and centipede lawns grow best with a soil pH of 5.0 to 5.5.But most plants prefer a higher pH of about 6.5 to thrive.Before adding.Adding Lime to SoilThe ideal soil pH is slightly acidic,between 6.0 and 7.0.When the soil pH drops below 6.0 (becomes more acidic),certain nutrients needed for proper grass growth,such as nitrogen,phosphorus,potassium,and calcium,become unavailable to certain nutrients for proper growth and other plants.
