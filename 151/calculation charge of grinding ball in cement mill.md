SAG is an acronym for semi autogenous grinding.SAG mills are autogenous mills that also use grinding balls like a ball mill.A SAG mill is usually a primary or first stage grinder.SAG mills use a ball charge of 8 to 21%.The largest SAG mill is 42' (12.8m)Ball Mill Charge2 &ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The ball charge and ore charge volume is a variable,subject to what is the target for that operation.The type of mill also is a factor as if it is an overflow mill (subject to the diameter of the discharge port) is usually up to about 45%.If it is a grate discharge you will have more flexibility of the total charge.

We can calculate the steel charge volume of a ball or rod mill and express it as the % of the volume within the liners that is filled with grinding media.While the mill is stopped,the charge volume can be gotten by measuring the diameter inside the liners and the distance from the top of the charge to the top of the mill.The % loading or change volume can then be read off the ‚Ä¶TECHNICAL NOTES 8 GRINDING R.P.Kingsteel balls in a ball mill,or large lumps of ore in an autogenous mill or a mixture in a semi autogenous mill,as well as the slurry that makes up the operating charge.Let Jt be the fraction of the mill volume that is occupied by the total charge,Jb the fraction of the mill volume that is occupied by steel balls and E the voidage of the balls
