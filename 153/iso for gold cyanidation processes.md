## Intensive Leaching Gekko
Cyanide leaching is commonly used worldwide for recovering gold from ore slurries or ore heaps.Gekko’s intensive cyanide leaching flowsheet advances the output of regular cyanide leaching.Combining higher concentrations of gold or silver with high cyanide and high oxygen amounts intensifies the chemical leaching reaction to maximise mineral recoveries.The Metallurgy of Cyanide Gold Leaching An …Cyanidation is used for gold that is distributed finely through a mineral matrix.Liberation: Cyanide leaching will only be effective if the cyanide can come in contact with the gold particle.For this to happen,the ore should either be sufficiently porous for cyanide to reach the gold,or more usually the ore is crushed and ground to a size at which the surface of the gold is exposed i.e.
