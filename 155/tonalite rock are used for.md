Tonalite rock:Tonalite is an igneous,plutonic rock,with phaneritic texture Feldspar is present as plagioclase with 10% or less alkali feldsparPlutonic Rocks: Definition and ExamplesThe large mineral grains in plutonic rocks don't generally have well formed crystals because they grew crowded together—that is,they are anhedral.An igneous rock from a shallower depth (with grains smaller than 1 mm,but not microscopic) may be classified as intrusive (or hypabyssal),if there's evidence that it never erupted onto the surface,or extrusive if it did erupt.
