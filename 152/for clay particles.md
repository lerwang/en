Clay,soil particles the diameters of which are less than 0.005 millimeter; also a rock that is composed essentially of clay particles.Rock in this sense includes soils,ceramic clays,clay shales,mudstones,glacial clays,and deep sea clays.Clay materials are plastic when wet and coherent when dry.26&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Although sieves work well for silt,sand,and larger particles,they are not appropriate for clay particles.Clay is far too small to sieve accurately; therefore,in soils with a high proportion of clay,the fine particles are measured on the basis of their settling velocity
