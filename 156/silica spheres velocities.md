Due to the strong absorption of silica around 10.6 ?m,surface tension induces highly symmetric silica spheres with a near atomically smooth surface[13].The sphere is held by a thin ?ber stem (cf.Fig.1 inset).The WGM are excited with high ideality[14].Surface roughness induced speed increase for active Janus …for the particle R 1 is due to the surface curvature of the silica spheres and hence cannot be mimicked by a planar wafer.After the deposition,each waf er piece was immersed in a 100 cm 3 Pyrex glass reactor containing 75 mL of 10% H 2O.
