## Chalcopyrite
20&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Industrial Uses: Chalcopyrite is mainly used for the copper that it contains.The most important use for chalcopyrite is as an ore of copper.Chalcopyrite does not yield as much copper as other copper rich rocks; however,it is more abundant and widespread making it the most accessible copper source.Copper is a vital material in our everyday.Chalcopyrite18&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Chalcopyrite is the main ore of copper.It is mostly copper iron sulphide.It is also known as peacock ore or peacock copper.It is often mistaken for bornite.This short article about science can be made longer.You can help Wikipedia by adding to it.

## Chalcopyrite
The principal copper ore mineral is chalcopyrite (CuFeS 2),which is commonly smelted to yield a matte containing ∼50% copper.In the presence of silica flux,iron is selectively oxidized to a slag.Figure 14 shows a PSD for the Cu Fe S O system at 1 atm SO 2 as a function of temperature (Rosenqvist 1978).Unlike the system for lead,the copper and Cu 2 S melts are nearly immiscible.ChalcopyriteChalcopyrite is the most important copper ore,and it is the primary source of many popular secondary copper minerals.It can occur in a variety of environments and forms,from hydrothermal veins to sedimentary layers.Nice chalcopyrite crystals are highly sought after by collectors.Structure
