How to Calculate Higher Heating Value By Jae Chapman April 12,2017 SAVE; Higher heating value (HHV) is one measure of the energy content of a material It is almost exclusively used in measuring energy content for fossil fuels and their alternatives,such as oil,coal,natural gas and biomass,Energy content of fuels,like coal,How to Calculate the Coal Quantity Used in a Power PlantEnergy content of coal is given in terms of KiloJoules (kJ) per Kilogram (kg) of coal as the Gross calorific value (GCV) or the Higher Heating value (HHV) of coal This value can vary from 10500 kJ kg to 25000 kJ kg depending on the quality and type of the coal

## Coal Wikipedia
The energy density of coal,ie its heating value,is roughly 24 megajoules per kilogram (approximately 67 kilowatt hours per kg) For a coal power plant with a 40% efficiency,it takes an estimated 325 kg (717 lb) of coal to power a 100 W lightbulb for one year,Consumption of Coal by Country and year (million tonnes) Country.Calculate How To3&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;water and space heating.the cost of generation and the cost of consumption.If the plant has only one steam generator (boiler),uses a single fuel,and has a single steam.The number 0.30 represents a typical value for the sum of cost components 2 through 9 above (in oil and gas fired facilities).However,it could be more in smaller.
