## Utilization of limestone powder to improve the …
Highlights Limestone powder was used to produce self compacting concrete incorporating RHA.The T 50cm flow times increased in mixtures containing RHA or RHA and LS.Combinations of LS and RHA improved the workability of SCC mixtures.The hardened properties of the concretes were progressively improved with addition of LS.Evaluation of the Improvement Effect of Limestone …The natural stone industry generates large amounts of industrial waste every year.Limestone powder produced by the activity of this industry is dumped into landfills,generating an environmental impact that could be reduced by using this waste as a binder in building materials.In the present work,the use of this by product as an addition for soil improvement of clayey soils has been studied.
