Abstract Across the UK there are around 22,000 landfills sites,suggesting a significant opportunity for recovering value from previously discarded materials.Enhanced landfill mining (ELFM) has been identified as a concept to recover value from landfills through.Enhanced Landfill Mining Toolkit2 1.Enhanced Landfill Mining Concept The ELFM concept was first introduced in Israel in 1953 as a method to obtain fertilisers for orchards.However,the concept was not reported of again until the 1990s,where significant interest in the topic arose as a

Mining is the extraction of valuable minerals or other geological materials from the Earth,usually from an ore body,lode,vein,seam,reef or placer deposit.These deposits form a mineralized package that is of economic interest to the miner.Ores recovered by mining include metals,coal,oil shale,gemstones,limestone,chalk,dimension.Landfill mining: Case study of a successful metals recovery …3.2.Methods The first step in the ashfill mining project was to determine the economic feasibility of mining based on the estimated concentration of metals in the ashfill.As noted above,post burn metals were not recovered nor analyzed for prior to 2004.In 2008.
