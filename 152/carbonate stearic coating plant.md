## EP2349929A1 Stearic acid treated calcium carbonate,
A method for treating calcium carbonate includes combining calcium carbonate with an amount of stearic acid and an amount of water to form a mixture,the amount of water being at least about 01 % by weight relative to the total weight The method further includes blending the mixture to form a stearic acid treated calcium carbonate compositionSTEARIC ACID COATED CALCIUM CARBONATE,Therefore,the proposed method is very successful to synthesize stearic acid coated calcium carbonate nanocrystallites from cheap and mundane dolomitic marbles to enable to fulfill the current.
