## Mill (grinding)
A mill is a device that breaks solid materials into smaller pieces by grinding,crushing,or cutting.Such comminution is an important unit operation in many processes.There are many different types of mills and many types of materials processed in them.Historically mills were powered by hand (e.g.via a hand crank),working animal (e.g.horse mill),wind or water ().TECHNICAL BULLETINforce is being applied.This can allow the liner to move about during mill operation,resulting in wear and or distortion to the mill head or shell bolt holes.This can also lead to bolt breakage through fatigue and ultimately to the liner coming loose from the shell.Bolts too tight can cause bolts …

## A discussion on the measurement of grinding media wear.
A material's susceptibility to wear depends on its physical and mechanical properties as well as on environmental factors,i.e.the conditions to which the material is exposed.In other words,the wear is a function of the tribosystem (),which is made up of four elements: body,counterbody,interfacial element and environmen
