Salt lingers in the air,and miners swear it does wonders for their sinuses.&quot;I've always considered it coming down to a health spa every day,&quot; miner John Goho said with a smile.But salt mining is a serious,sometimes dangerous business,practiced in this western New York countryside since the days of mules and pickaxes more than a century ago.Extracting saltRock salt is the name for dry salt that is extracted from salt bearing (saliniferous) rock layers with the help of mining methods.Most salt mines operate underground,but in salt deserts the rock salt is also mined on the surface (open cast mining).Rock salt (halite) is salt left behind by the primordial oceans millions of years ago when.

## Modeling the mining of energy storage salt caverns …
The salt cavern develops due to the dissolution of the salt surface,which is a complicated process with ion diffusion and convection.There is a large concentration difference at the salt brine interface.Sodium and chloride ions leave the surface of rock salt and enter the boundary layer with high concentration.Mining Salt From the Sea2011 10 31&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;When I started this process,I was concerned with safety.After all,I had heard of salt from the farthest reaches of the globe,and selmeliers in fancy restaurants matching the appropriate salt to each course,but none of it came from the North Atlantic.That most salts sounded like potent,artisanal marijuana only heightened my intrigue: Utah.
