## A Poor Man's Method of Smelting Gold Sciencing
Smelting gold usually involves high tech and high cost tools to perform.Mostly,mining companies do the procedure,which sees one material bonded to or released from another in the presence of extreme heat.However,prospectors,and people at home,can smelt.SmeltingSmelting is a process of applying heat to ore in order to extract a base metal.It is a form of extractive metallurgy.It is used to extract many metals from their ores,including silver,iron,copper,and other base metals.Smelting uses heat and a chemical reducing agent to decompose the ore,driving off other elements as gases or slag and leaving the metal base behind.

## How gold is made
Gold,recognizable by its yellowish cast,is one of the oldest metals used by humans.As far back as the Neolithic period,humans have collected gold from stream beds,and the actual mining of gold can be traced as far back as 3500 B.C.when early Egyptians (the Sumerian culture of Mesopotamia) used mined gold to craft elaborate jewelry,religious artifacts,and utensils such as goblets.Gold Smelting &amp; Refining ProcessGold Smelting Equipment It has been shown that concentrates obtained by gravity devices and cathodes can be smelted directly most the time.Silver gold concentrates can be smelted too.Under this consideration,a concentrate must contain at least 20 oz t of
