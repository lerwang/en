## How Is Gold Extracted From Gold Ore? Sciencing
Gold is usually found alone or alloyed with mercury or silver,but can also be found in ores such as calaverite,sylvanite,nagyagite,petzite and krennerite.Most gold ore now comes from either open pit or underground mines.The ores sometimes contain as little as 5Precious Metal Heap Leach Design and Practice2012 5 25&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Precious Metal Heap Leach Design and Practice Daniel W.Kappes1 ABSTRACT Heap leaching of gold and silver ores is conducted at approximately 120 mines worldwide.Heap leaching is one of several alternative process methods for treating precious metal ores,and is selected primarily to take advantage of its low capital cost relative to other methods.

2016 1 25&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;available for the extraction of gold metal from its ores.Amongst these methods,cyanidation is the most common method used in the leaching of gold from the ore.This process involves the dissolution of gold containing ores in dilute cyanide solution in the presence of lime and oxygen.For refractory ores such asReading: Open Pit Mining GeologyGold is generally extracted in open pit mines at 1 to 2 ppm (parts per million) but in certain cases,0.75 ppm gold is economical.This was achieved by bulk heap leaching at the Peak Hill mine in western New South Wales,near Dubbo,Australia.

## How do we extract minerals?
Higher grade metallic ores found in veins deep under the Earth’s surface can be profitably mined using underground methods,which tend to be more expensive.Large tabular shaped ore bodies or ore bodies lying more than 1,000 feet (300 m) below the surfaceCentrifuge Gold RecoveryWe claim 99% recovery of free gold down to 100 mesh and 80% to 90% recovery down to 200 mesh.Recovery rates of free gold particles at 300 mesh minus start getting out of reach of physical concentration means and require chemical separation methods.300 mesh gold is almost colloidal and tends to stay in suspension in the turbid water.
