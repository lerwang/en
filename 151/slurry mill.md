## How Slurry Transport inside a Tumbling Grinding Mills
The transport of slurry within the ball mill depends on the peripheral velocity and porosity of the ball charge.Residence time distribution and mill hold up are often used as indicators of the mode of transport.In this work,the transport problem is tackled via direct simulation of the three dimensional motion of the ball charge.AMIT 135: Lesson 8 Rod Mills Mining Mill Operator TrainingUnder given load and particle size requirement,capacity is a function of mill length and diameter: Q = kLD 2+N.N is related to mill diameter which decreases with larger diameters k a constant equal to π 4.A chart showing rod mill capacity vs.mill
