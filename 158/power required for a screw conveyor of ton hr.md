## How to calculate the capacity of a screw conveyor in ‚Ä¶
Since you have asked the questions using two mass units per time,I am assuming you are trying to compute the rate of delivery of some number or volume of screws per unit of time to the end of the conveyor.This simple computation could take sever.Vertical Screw Conveyor4 Im = mass flow rate (ton per hour) ùúÜ = Progress resistance coefficient L = length (m) H = height of the Vertical screw driver (L sin90o ) The driving power of the loaded screw conveyor is given by,P = PV + PN + Pst Where,PV = required power to move the material
