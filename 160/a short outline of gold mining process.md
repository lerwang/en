## Mining
Mining Mining Underground mining: When any ore body lies a considerable distance below the surface,the amount of waste that has to be removed in order to uncover the ore through surface mining becomes prohibitive,and underground techniques must be considered.Counting against underground mining are the costs,which,for each ton of material mined,are much higher underground than on the.4 Coal Mining and Processing Coal: Research and.2020 2 24&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Recommendation: There should be renewed support for advanced coal mining and processing research and development to optimize use of the nation’s coal resources by increasing the amount of coal that is economically minable through technological advances that accommodate health,safety,and environmental

Gold is purified by means of a smelting process,which utilizes pressure,high heat and chemicals to accomplish the task.Like any metal that appears naturally in the earth,there are impurities that must be removed.Removing minerals and other impurities allows gold to be used in …Aluminium production processThe pure form of aluminium does not naturally occur in nature,so remained largely unknown until as recently as 200 years ago.Creating aluminium using electricity was first developed in 1886 and is still used to this day.The aluminium production process starts with the mining of bauxites,an aluminium rich mineral in in the
