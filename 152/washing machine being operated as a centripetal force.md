## How do centrifuges work? Explain that Stuff
31 Aug 2016 Photo: A clothes washer drum is a type of centrifuge.So &quot;centrifugal force gets your washing dry because it makes the water fly The huge spinning arms are powered by two 1250 horsepower motors and produce forces up to 30g (30 When it comes to the final spin,the machine will be banging andCentrifugal Pumps How Does a Centrifugal Pump …How do they work? All centrifugal pumps include a shaft driven impeller that rotates (usually at 1750 or 3500 RPM) inside a casing.The impeller is always submerged in water,and when the pump is operational the impeller spins rapidly.The centrifugal force applied to the water from this rotation forces the water outside of the casing,where it exits a discharge port.

## how does a centrifugal force implemented in washind.
 · Best Answer: The drum spin rotates very fast and the clothes are forced to the drum walls due to centrifugal force.(things being spun tend to head to the edges),The wall of the drum,in the washer,has many holes that allow water particles to pass through the wall to be dumped.How do I explain this problem? Centripetal Centrifugal force!The purpose of a spin cycle of a washing machine is to remove water from cloth The drum of radius,r,rotating with speed,v,will have a centripetal acceleration which is provided by a centripetal force,acting toward the centre of the drum,which in turn has an equal and opposite reaction (centrifugal?) force
