## Cement Manufacturing Process Flow Chart
Burning Cement Clinker; Cement Grinding; Cement Packing And Storage; In the cement manufacturing process,most material must be broken,such as limestone,iron ore,clay and coal etc.Limestone is the main raw material for cement production,each producing a ton of clinker needs about 1.3 tons of limestone,more than 80% of raw material is.cement Definition,Composition,Manufacture,…Cement,in general,adhesive substances of all kinds,but,in a narrower sense,the binding materials used in building and civil engineering construction.Cements of this kind are finely ground powders that,when mixed with water,set to a hard mass.Setting and hardening result from hydration,which is a chemical combination of the cement compounds with water that yields submicroscopic.
