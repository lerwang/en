## iron ore revery mining machinery
Increasing iron ore demand,coupled with the depletion of high grade hematite ores in the United States,after World War II led to development of lower grade iron ore sources,principally the utilization of magnetite and taconite.Iron ore mining methods vary by the type of ore being mined.There are four main types of iron ore deposits worked.What is a theoretical grade recovery curve? An example.The theoretical grade recovery curve for an ore is a definition of the maximum expected recovery by flotation of a mineral or element at a given grade.This is defined by the surface area liberation of the value minerals and is consequently directly related to the grind size utilised in the process.
