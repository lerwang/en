## The Cement Manufacturing Process Advancing Mining
Cement manufacturing is a complex process that begins with mining and then grinding raw materials that include limestone and clay,to a fine powder,called raw meal,which is then heated to a sintering temperature as high as 1450 &#176;C in a cement kilnSETTING PROCESS OF CEMENT The Constructor Civil,When water is mixed with cement to form a paste,reaction starts In its pure form,the finely ground cement is extremely sensitive to water Out of the three main compounds,viz C3A,C3S and C2S,reacts quickly with water to produce a jelly like compound which starts solidifying,

## Cement Cargo Handbook the world's largest cargo,
Cement is made by heating limestone (calcium carbonate) with small quantities of other materials (such as clay) to 1450 &#176;C in a kiln,in a process known as calcination,whereby a molecule of carbon dioxide is liberated from the calcium carbonate to form calcium oxide,or quicklime.How concrete is made material,manufacture,making,Concrete's strength is influenced by its moisture level during the hardening process: as the cement solidifies,the concrete shrinks If site constraints prevent the concrete from contracting,tensile stresses will develop,weakening the concrete
