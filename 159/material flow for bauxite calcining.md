## Chapter 2 Production and Processing of Aluminum
According to the grade of the bauxite ore,2 3 tonnes of ore yield one tonne of alumina and about one tonne of red mud (dry weight) When designing an alumina plant,factors other than the type of bauxite ore to be used as feed material and the form of alumina to be produced have to be taken into consideration A high silica content of the.Bauxite Calcination Plant by Rotary Kiln with Fine,Bauxite Calcination Plant by Rotary Kiln with Fine Grinding Ball Mill Refractory Grade Calcined Bauxite Calcined bauxite is produced by sintering calcining of low iron,low alkali containing raw bauxites at temperatures of 1600 1800 degree Celsius In this calcination process the high refractory mineral phase’s corundum and mullite are.

## Calcined Bauxite in Rajkot,Gujarat Get Latest Price,
Calcined Bauxite is produced by calcining (heating) superior grade Bauxite at high temperature (from 850 &#176;C to 1600 &#176;C) Calcining superior Bauxite at high temperature removes moisture and thus it increases the alumina content in it The heating is done in rotary kilns The calcination process is,Calcination WikipediaThe IUPAC defines calcination as "heating to high temperatures in air or oxygen" However,calcination is also used to mean a thermal treatment process in the absence or limited supply of air or oxygen applied to ores and other solid materials to bring about a thermal decompositionA calciner is a steel cylinder that rotates inside a heated furnace and performs indirect high temperature.
