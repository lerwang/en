## India
The objective of the Coal Fired Generation Rehabilitation Project for India is to improve energy efficiency and environmental performance of selected coal fired power generation units through renovation and modernization (R&amp;M) and improved operations.Use of Coal Bottom Ash for Wastewater TreatmentUse of Coal Bottom Ash for Wastewater Treatment India is largely dependent on coal power,which provides for around 56% of the country’s electrical supply needs.1 The country hosts vast coal reserves in Jharkhand,Odisha,Chhattisgarh,West Bengal,Madhya Pradesh,Telangana and Maharashtra.2 This makes coal the most important raw material used in thermal power plants to generate.
