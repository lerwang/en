## How is platinum extracted from its ore
How is platinum extracted from its ore 1.How is platinum extracted from its Ore? An ore is a naturally occurring mineral from which a pure metal can be extracted.For Platinum,the two chief minerals are sperrylite or platinum arsenide (PtAs2) andSulfurSulfur burns with a blue flame with formation of sulfur dioxide,which has a suffocating and irritating odor.Sulfur is insoluble in water but soluble in carbon disulfide and,to a lesser extent,in other nonpolar organic solvents,such as benzene and toluene.
