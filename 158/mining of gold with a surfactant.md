## Flotation Froth
Since plastics are generally hydrophobic materials,froth flotation has successfully been used for the separation of plastic materials.5,137 5 137 For example,two plastic materials which are buoyant in a specific liquid phase can be separated from one another by the addition of a wetting agent which selectively adsorbs to one of the plastics and not the other.Chemical Used in Gold MiningChemical Used in Gold Mining Refractory Gold Ores.The gold also occurs as sub microscopic particles in sulphides or as absorbed gold onto surfaces of carbonaceous matter.Because of the variation of these refractory ores,gold occurrence is ore specific and before process decisions are made,competent mineralogical and metallurgical evaluation must be carried before final process decisions.
