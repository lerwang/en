## INVESTIGATIONS ON ALKALINE METHODS FOR …
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Along with sulfation in application to monazite,alkaline methods have been introduced recently on a commercial scale in a number of countries.Judging by the literature,the alkaline method of decomposition of the mineral is accomplished,as a rule,by heating finely ground monazite concentrates.Monazite geochronologyMonazite geochronology is a dating technique to study geological history using the mineral monazite.It is a powerful tool in studying the complex history of metamorphic rocks particularly,as well as igneous,sedimentary and hydrothermal rocks.[2][3] The dating uses the radioactive processes in monazite as a clock.The uniqueness of monazite.
