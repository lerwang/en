## Coal fired power station
A coal fired power station is a type of fossil fuel power station.The coal is usually pulverized and then burned in a furnace with a boiler.The furnace heat converts boiler water to steam,which is then used to spin turbines which turn generators.Thus chemical energy stored in coal is converted successively into thermal energy,mechanical energy and,finally,electrical energy.Thermal Power Plant Working INDIAN POWER SECTORAdvantages of coal based thermal Power Plant They can respond to rapidly changing loads without difficulty A portion of the steam generated can be used as a process steam in different industries Steam engines and turbines can work under 25 % of overload
