## Hematite
Such crystals are known as specular hematite (also specularite and iron glance) because of better light reflectance.The habit of crystals is versatile as well.It may form botryoidal kidney ores which have a radial fibrous structure (pencil ore) in the interior of the crystal.Hematite may be platy (micaceous hematite).HEMATITEFigure 92: Hematite,botryoidal hematite (“kidney ore”) from the Mather mine,Ishpeming,Marquette County,8 x.crystals of hematite occur on botryoidal prehnite and on native copper in prehnite calcite veins (Moore and Beger,1963).Occurs sparingly at the.

## Hematite
Hematite,also spelled as haematite,is a common iron oxide with a formula called Fe2O3 and has been widespread in rocks and soils.[5] Hematite forms in the shape of crystals through the rhombohedral lattice system,and it has the same crystal structure as ilmenite and corundum.Hematite and ilmenite form a complete solid solution at.HematiteThere are nine known minerals species at this locale including hematite.It is an oxide that contains the elements Fe and O.This specimen is entirely made up of hematite with a botryoidal crystalline structure.This type of hematite is commonly called kidney ore.

Hematite This mineral comes in many forms,both metallic and nonmetallic,such as: botryoidal (known as kidney ore),micaceous and foliated known as specular; and earthy,oolitic,iron roses.But regardless of its form,it can always be identified by its characteristic red streak.Kidney OreHematite Another of my Kidney ore specimens and I have always had a fondness for these hematites.My mother (Born UK 1908) often spoke about the minerals she had seen a young girl in the 1920’s from the Iron Mines of Northern England.
