## Mill (grinding)
A mill is a device that breaks solid materials into smaller pieces by grinding,crushing,or cutting.Such comminution is an important unit operation in many processes.There are many different types of mills and many types of materials processed in them.Historically mills were powered by hand (e.g.via a hand crank),working animal (e.g.Bond Ball Mill Index Test JKTechA Bond Ball Mill Work Index may also be used in the simulation and optimisation of existing mill(s) and the associated grinding circuit(s).Sample Requirements: A minimum of 8 kg of material crushed to nominally minus 10 mm is preferred.JKTech would stage crush the sample to minus 3.35 mm,as requir
