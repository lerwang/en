## Long wall mining making a comeback in India
Longwall mining making a comeback in India.longwall mining had been restricting its use to blocks left over by the bord and pillar mining method,and the longwall mining process co existing.bord and pillar coal miningBord and pillar: Bord and pillar,or room and pillar,is the oldest underground mining technique and was common in NSW before longwall mining began in the 1960s.This method uses a grid of tunnels and involves progressively cutting panels into the coal seam whilst leaving behind pillars of coal to support the mine.
