## Safe Flushing Pumps &amp; Systems
However,clean water is often unavailable,too costly and sometimes the addition of water cannot be tolerated.In these cases,a cyclone separator can be employed to remove dirt and grit from the fluid being pumped,before safely using it for the seals andCyclone Dust SeparatorCyclone dust separation is a useful method for removing polluted particles from air,gas or water stream through vortex separation.Rotational effects and gravity are used to separate mixtures of solids and fluids.The polluted particles and fluids go into a rotational.
