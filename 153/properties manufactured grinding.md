## Abrasive
An abrasive is a material,often a mineral,that is used to shape or finish a workpiece through rubbing[1] which leads to part of the workpiece being worn away by friction.While finishing a material often means polishing it to gain a smooth,reflective surface,the process can also involve roughening as in satin,matte or beaded finishes.In.Grinding Improves Surface Finish in 3D Printed Inconel,…The results of this study proved that finish grinding of additively manufactured,nickel based superalloys,such as Inconel 718,can be successfully employed to achieve a reduction in surface roughness of approximately 94 percent when measured parallel to the.
