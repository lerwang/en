## Antimony
Antimony is a chemical element with the symbol Sb (from Latin: stibium) and atomic number 51.A lustrous gray metalloid,it is found in nature mainly as the sulfide mineral stibnite (Sb2S3).Antimony compounds have been known since ancient times and were powdered for use as medicine and cosmetics,often known by the Arabic name kohl.[5.Iron(II,III) oxideIron(II,III) oxide is the chemical compound with formula Fe3O4.It occurs in nature as the mineral magnetite.It is one of a number of iron oxides,the others being iron(II) oxide (FeO),which is rare,and iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3) also known as hematite.It contains both Fe2+ and Fe3+ ions and is sometimes formulated as FeO ∙ Fe2O3.This iron.
