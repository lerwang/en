## What Is Grade Of Concrete Concrete Grade Ratio Grade,
Grade of Concrete Grades of concrete are defined by the concrete mix proportion and the minimum strength of concrete at end of 28 days curing period The Concrete Grade is can be known by calculating th e compressive strength of concrete in Mpa,where M stands for mix and the MPa denotes the overall strengthConcrete mix ratio for various grades of concrete,This paste is also called as concrete The strength of this concrete mix is determined by the proportion on which these cement,sand,stones or aggregates are mixed There are various grades of concrete available in the market based on these ratios Some of them are: M10,M20,M30,M35,etc So,what really does M10 or M20 mean or represent

## Conventional grade C20,C25 and C30 concrete mix ratio,
There are two methods: one is to use a variety of materials amount per 1 cubic meters,such as cement 300 kg,water 180 kg,sand 690 kg,gravel 1260 kg; the other is that the water cement ratio and cement ratio and concrete content of different materials per unit mass of the cases,such as precedent can be written as: C:S:G=1:23:42,W C=06Calculate Cement Sand &amp; Aggregate M20,M15,…For example,in M20 ratio concrete M stands for “Mix” and 20 is the strength of concrete,in terms of Newton per millimetre square,in 28 days after curing.Concrete Mix Ratio by Volume.Concrete mix ratios are prescribed ratio of cement,sand and aggregate to get the desired strength in concrete.
