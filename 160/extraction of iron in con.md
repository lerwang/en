Reference.comIron ores in the form of hematite (ferrous oxide) and magnetite are removed from the earth through mining.The use of heavy mining equipment is necessary to dig out large pits in an area with a large deposit of iron ore; however,because iron does not occur naturally,it is necessary to use a blast furnace to separate or refine iron from the other substances in the iron ore.

## Write down the reactions taking place in different Zones.
In the blast furnace,reduction of iron oxides takes place in different temperature ranges.Coke is burnt to get the required temperature upto about 2200K.The temperature is lower in the upper part.Hence,the reduction of iron oxides take place at lower portion.The higher temperature range,depend on the points of corresponding intersections in the ΔrG0 vs T plots.(PDF) Extraction of Iron from Vanadium Slag Using Pressure.method for the extraction of iron from slags.Using the optimum conditions,which included a reaction tim e of 60 min,H + slag ratio of 35:1,leaching temperature of 180 °C and additive.
