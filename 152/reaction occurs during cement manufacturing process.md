13&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Cement In the most general sense of the word,a cement is a binder,a substance that sets and hardens independently,and can bind other materials together.Cement used in construction is characterized as hydraulic or non hydraulic.Hydraulic cements (e.g.Portland cement) harden because of hydration,chemical reactionsQ&amp;A: Why cement emissions matter for climate …Why does cement emit so much CO2? Around half of the emissions from cement are process emissions arising from the reaction above.This is a principle reason cement emissions are often considered difficult to cut: since this CO2 is released by a chemical reaction,it can not be eliminated by changing fuel or increasing efficiency.
