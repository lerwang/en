## Additive manufacturing of metal bonded grinding …
Grinding tools with superabrasive grains can be manufactured from different bond materials.In several industrial applications,metallic bond systems are used.In general,these show good grain retention and offer a high thermal conductivity,when compared to the other widely used bond types such as vitrified and resin bonds.One drawback of the metallic bond is the lack of pores in the.Grinding,Blending and Pelletizing Additives9 &ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The frictional heat generated by the grinding media tends to soften the sample creating a “caking” effect shielding the underlying mass from further comminution.The recommended starting point is to evaluate a 1 to 1 2 wt.% additive to sample weight (e.g.0.1 to 0.25gm additive to 10gm sample).
