Kaolin Clay Kaolin clay has an empirical formula of Al 2 O 3 2SiO 2 2H 2 O.Although there are several forms of the mineral,kaolinite is the most abundant of these.It occurs in three morphologies that are available to the pulp and paper industry; these areUS5223463AA process for producing a high brightness,high solids kaolin clay aqueous slurry.An aqueous low solids suspension of crude kaolin clay is degritted,and subjected to a particle size classification.The aqueous suspension of the fine particle fraction is acidified to a pH of 5.0 or lower to produce an acid flocculated suspension which is treated with a bleaching agent to reduce ferric ion.
