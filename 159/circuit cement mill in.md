## Cement mill
A cement mill (or finish mill in North American usage) is the equipment used to grind the hard,nodular clinker from the cement kiln into the fine grey powder that is cement.Most cement is currently ground in ball mills and also vertical roller mills which are more effective than ball mills.Effect of pre crushing with a &#173;vertical shaft impactor.Grinding performance and circuit capacity change were investigated when an industrial scale VSI crusher was integrated into the two compartment ball mill closed circuit.Semi finish grinding application of a VSI crusher could result in 8 % capacity increase in cement throughput rate and thus,7 % energy saving in specific energy consumption.
