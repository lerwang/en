## 2.1 Hydrometallurgy
2.1.3 The chemistry of hydrometallurgical processes Hydrometallurgy is based on the chemistry of an aqueous solution.At first it may seem that this would severely restrict the range of processing options that can be exploited,however,this is misleadingHydrometallurgical ProcessingIn this chapter,the major methods of copper and copper alloy powder production,including atomization,solid phase reduction of copper oxide,electrolysis,hydrometallurgical processing,and oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) are discussed.
