## Pavement materials: Aggregates
The aggregate crushing value provides a relative measure of resistance to crushing under gradually applied crushing load.The test consists of subjecting the specimen of aggregate in standard mould to a compression test under standard load conditions (Figure 1).Dry aggregates passing through 12.5 mm sieves and retained 10 mm sieves are filled.AGGREGATE CRUSHING VALUE (IS: Part 1963) …11&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;AGGREGATE CRUSHING VALUE 1.Objective The aggregate crushing value gives a relative measure of the resistance of an aggregate to crushing under a gradually applied compressive load.With aggregate of aggregate crushing value 30 or higher,the result may be anomalous,and in such cases the ten percent fines value should be determined instead.
