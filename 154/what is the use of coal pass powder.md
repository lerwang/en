## What is activated charcoal and how is it different from …
Activated charcoal is charcoal that has been heated to high tempatures and then treated with oxygen.The process forms a product that is low in volume but very porous greatly increasing the surface area.It is the high surface area and oxygenation.Coal Burners in Large Thermal Power PlantsCoal burning in large power plant boilers takes place in different ways.By pulverizing to a fine powder and being piped into different burners placed in the furnace of the boiler.Large capacity power plant boilers use this method.By circulating fluidized bed where large coal particles spread on to the bottom of the furnace and the air pressure from the bottom keeps it floating to give good.
