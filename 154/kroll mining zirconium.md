## Kroll process metallurgy Britannica
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;In titanium: Occurrence,properties,and usesIn the Kroll process,one of the ores,such as ilmenite (FeTiO 3) or rutile (TiO 2),is treated at red heat with carbon and chlorine to yield titanium tetrachloride,TiCl 4,which is fractionally distilled to eliminate impurities such as ferric chloride,FeCl 3.Zirconium in 1997Kroll process.Zirconium oxide,also called zirconia,has the fift h highest melting point of the binary oxides.Hafn ium is a bright silver.Zircon is normally produced as a byproduct of the mining an d proce ssing of heavy mineral sands for the titanium minerals.
