## Scandium speciation in a world class lateritic deposit
Scandium is often associated with the rare earth elements (REE).The ionic radius of Sc 3+ is slightly smaller than those of heavy REE for the same coordination number.During lateritic weathering of ultramafic mafic rocks,Sc behaves like the heavy REE.The enrichment factor of Sc between the ore and fresh saprolite is ca.5 (Table S,Fig.Scandium speciation in a world class lateritic depositScandium speciation in a world class lateritic deposit.duration of the weathering process and tectonic stability are key factors leading to the development of such volumes of ore.Exceptional concentration of Sc in lateritic deposits thus results from a combination of three circumstances: (1) anomalously high Sc concentration in the parent.

## The Economic Geology of Scandium,the Runt of the Rare.
In many scandium deposits,clinopyroxene is the main ore mineral,although in some deposits scandium is hosted by minerals that also concentrate the other REEs.As is the case for these other REEs,the main source of scandium is the mantle and the conveyors of scandium are alkaline igneous rocks (and carbonatites),including Alaskan type.Scandium WikipediaA process for recovering scandium economically with high efficiency by concentration and separation from an oxide ore containing nickel and a small amount of scandium as well as a large amount of iron and or aluminum comprises the steps of acid leaching the oxide ore under a high temperature,high pressure oxidative atmosphere while restraining leaching of the iron and or aluminum,thereby.
