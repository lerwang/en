## Copper extraction
Copper Mining: The commonest ore used in the extraction of copper is Chalcopyrite (CuFeS 2) also known as Copper Pyrites and other such sulfides.The percentage of copper in the actual ore is too low for direct extraction of copper to be viable.The concentration of ore is required and it is done by the Froth Flotation method.Concentration of Ores: Hydraulic Washing,Froth Flotation …Copper Pyrite Cinnabar Argentine Sol: Gold and silver ores are concentrated by leaching.In this method,we treat the ore with a suitable reagent in which ore is soluble but impurities do not.Thus,impurities are removed by filtration.
