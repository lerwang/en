## Aurorra Gold Mining: Non Cyanide Leaching
Washing the ore can remove many soluble minerals,some of which may interfere with the leaching operation.One must be careful not to wash any of the gold from the ore.If the ore is to be concentrated,then washing need not be attempted,since theCrushing,Grinding and Concentration of the Ore …b) Concentration is carried out by digesting powdered ore with a concentrated solution of sodium hydroxide at 473 523 K and 36 bar pressure.c) In this process Al 2 O 3 dissolves in alkali to form soluble sodium aluminate and silica (SiO 2) dissolves as sodium silicate,leaving behind the impurities.
