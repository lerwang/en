## 3 CALCULATION OF MACHINE RATES
31 Introduction The unit cost of logging or road construction is essentially derived by dividing cost by production In its simplest case,if you rented a tractor with operator for $60 per hour including all fuel and other costs and you excavated 100 cubic meters per hour,your unit cost for excavation would be $060 per cubic meterTOOLS AND EQUIPMENTequipment.For every construction activity there is an optimum combination of equipment and labour.In order to utilize the equipment and labour in the most effective way,the use of equipment needs to be carefully coordinated with the output of the work gangs.
