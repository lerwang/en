Artisanal mining and processing could ideally focus on lead poor ores.However,economic considerations will likely drive processing of all gold bearing ores regardless of lead content.Hence,methods are needed to identify ores that require mitigation of leadMethods of Gold MiningHard rock mining Hard rock gold mining extracts gold encased in rock,rather than fragments in loose sediment,and produces most of the world's gold.Sometimes open pit mining is used,such as at the Fort Knox Mine in central Alaska.

## Shaft mining
Shaft mining or shaft sinking is excavating a vertical or near vertical tunnel from the top down,where there is initially no access to the bottom.[1] Shallow shafts,typically sunk for civil engineering projects differ greatly in execution method from deep shafts,typically sunk for mining projects.When the top of the excavation is the.Shaft Mining,Mining Techniques,Underground Mining,…Shaft Mining Shaft mining is a form of underground mining where shafts are pushed vertically from top to bottom to excavate the ores and minerals.It is also called shaft sinking.It is best suited for concentrated minerals such as iron,coal,etc.which can be found at.
