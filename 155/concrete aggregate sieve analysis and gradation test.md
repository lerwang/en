## Sieve Analysis of Aggregates
SIEVE ANALYSIS Sieve analysis helps to determine the particle size distribution of the coarse and fine aggregates.This is done by sieving the aggregates as per IS: 2386 (Part I) 1963.In this we use different sieves as standardized by the IS code and then pass.Gradation and SizeThe particle size distribution,or gradation,of an aggregate is one of the most influential aggregate characteristics in determining how it will perform as a pavement material.In HMA,gradation helps determine almost every important property including stiffness,stability,durability,permeability,workability,fatigue resistance,frictional resistance and moisture susceptibility (Roberts et.
