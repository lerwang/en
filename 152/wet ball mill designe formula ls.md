## Calculate and Select Ball Mill Ball Size for Optimum Grinding
In Grinding,selecting (calculate) the correct or optimum ball size that allows for the best and optimum ideal or target grind size to be achieved by your ball mill is an important thing for a Mineral Processing Engineer AKA Metallurgist to do.Often,the ball used in ball mills is oversize “just in case”.Well,this safety factor can cost you much in recovery and or mill liner wear and tear.CALCULATION OF THE POWER DRAW OF DRY …Bond ball mill grindability test for overflow wet ball mills.An approach was proposed by Erdem (2002) for dry multi component cement grinding ball mills,using the results of the Bond ball mill grindability test.For all model based methods,a reliable method to calculate mill power draw for a

## The energy efficiency of ball milling in comminution.
Schellinger's calculated ball mill efficiency,in dry or wet ball mill grinding,ranges between 10% and 19%,with the higher figure occurring at the optimal mill loading.In terms of the Brace and Walsh surface free energy of quartz,his results give a ball mill efficiency that is less than 0.5%.Mill (grinding)Ball mill.A typical type of fine grinder is the ball mill.A slightly inclined or horizontal rotating cylinder is partially filled with balls,usually stone or metal,which grind material to the necessary fineness by friction and impact with the tumbling balls.Ball mills normally operate with an ap
