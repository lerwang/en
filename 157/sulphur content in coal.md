## Sulfur dioxide and coal SourceWatch
While "coal" is often described as a single commodity,in fact coal varies widely in important physical characteristics such as energy content (usually measured in British Thermal Units,BTU ),carbon percentage,moisture content,presence of contaminants such as sulfur,etcUSGS Bulletin 1823The total sulfur content of a sample is determined by use of the LECO R SC132 sulfur analyzer (LECO Corporation,1980; Kirschenbaum,1983).Calibration of the sulfur analyzer is based on one of the LECO coal standards (LECO Corporation,1980).

According to Wikipedia,the anthracite and bituminous coal both have about 1% sulfur content And according to this PDF from Purdue University (pg 13) anthracite has the lowest sulfur content All three links also say that anthracite has the highest carbon and the lowest VOC content of the four primary coal typSulfur dioxide and coal SourceWatchSulfur dioxide and coal From SourceWatch,and West Virginia has higher sulfur content,accounting for 3 to 10 percent of the coal's weight; coal from western states such as Wyoming,Montana,Utah,and Colorado can have sulfur contents that make up less than 1 percent of its weight However,low sulfur coal is significantly more,

## Coal
All coal sold in Ireland for home heating must meet certain minimum requirements regarding sulphur content.Limiting the sulphur content of smoky coal helps to protect human health and the environment by reducing air pollution,especially in winter.
