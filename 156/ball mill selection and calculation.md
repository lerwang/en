The theoretical critical speed of a ball mill is the speed at which the centrifugal force is sufficiently large to cause a small particle to adhere to the shell interior for a full revolution of the mill.The common range of mill speeds is 65% to 80% of critical,depending on mill type,size and the application.The Selection and Design of Mill LinersFigure 5.High low wave ball mill liner Materials The selection of the material of construction is a function of the application,abrasivity of ore,size of mill,corrosion environment,size of balls,mill speed,etc.liner design and material of construction are

## various ball mill critical speed calculation
Ball mills have been successfully run at speeds between 60 and 90 percent of critical speed,but most mills operate at speeds between 65 and 79 percent of critical speed.Rod mills speed should be limited to a maximum of 70% of critical speed and preferably should be in the 60 to 68 percent critical speed range.Ball Mill Design Power CalculationThe basic parameters used in ball mill design (power calculations),rod mill or any tumbling mill sizing are; material to be ground,characteristics,Bond Work Index,bulk density,specific density,desired mill tonnage capacity DTPH,operating % solids or pulp density,feed size as F80 and maximum ‚Äòchunk size‚Äô,product size as P80 and maximum and finally the type of circuit open closed.
