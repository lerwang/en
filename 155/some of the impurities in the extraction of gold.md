## Extraction Process of Aluminium from Bauxite Ore
Alumina Extraction Problem In the standard Bayer Process for refining bauxite to produce alumina,the dissolution of the alumina in the ore to form sodium aluminate is accomplished in autoclaves under high pressures varying from 70 to 200 pounds per square inch.The Extraction of Gold from E waste by Hydrometallurgymoles choric acid.More than 99.92 percent of the dissolved gold with some impurities entered the aqueous phase.The effect of three factors the proportion of acid,time,and temperature on the extraction of gold were observed and analyzed: they have no

## Separating the Platinum Group Metals by Liquid Liquid.
Separating the Platinum Group Metals by Liquid Liquid Extraction NEW PROCESS HAS POTENTIAL ECONOMIC ADVANTAGES OVER CONVENTIONAL SELECTIVE PRECIPITATION By P.Charlesworth Marthc.! Kuqtenhurg Refiners (I’K) Limited,Ro&gt;ston,England To extract the platinum group metals from ore,and to refine them to the very high purity required for their many applications,Gold refining by solvent extraction—the Minataur™ Processsolvent extraction.Gold is selectively extracted into the organic phase,while other soluble metal ions report to the raffinate.Small quantities of co extracted impurities are scrubbed from the loaded organic before it is stripped to produce a purified,concentrated.
