## wet grinding advantages Henan Deya Machinery Co.Ltd.
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Wet grinding is generally used in mineral processing operations because of the overall economies of operation.The advantages of wet grinding are: 1.It consumes lower power per ton of product.2.It has higher capacity per unit mill volume.3.It makes possible the use of wet screening or classification for close product control.4.Mill (grinding)[citation needed] But note that the term 'rod mill' is also used as a synonym for a slitting mill,which makes rods of iron or other metal.Rod mills are less common than ball mills for grinding minerals.The rods used in the mill,usually a high carbon steel,can vary in both the length and the diameter.
