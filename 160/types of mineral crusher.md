## Crusher
23&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks,gravel,or rock dust.Crushers may be used to reduce the size,or change the form,of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled,or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore),so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.Rock Crushers for Commercial Gold Mining Operations.&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Rock crushers usually hold the rocks to be crushed in between two solid surfaces and apply a force that forces the molecule of the materials to separate or change alignment.Rock crushers are extensively applied in the mining sector where rocks containing the ore are crushed before the mineral is extracted.
