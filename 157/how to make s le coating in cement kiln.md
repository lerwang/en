## Cement kiln
6&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Cement kilns are used for the pyroprocessing stage of manufacture of Portland and other types of hydraulic cement,in which calcium carbonate reacts with silica bearing minerals to form a mixture of calcium silicates.Over a billion tonnes of cement are made per year,and cement kilns are the heart of this production process: their capacity.Cement Kilns: Clinker Thermochemistry14&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;A current of hot air,with a CO 2 partial pressure of 40 Pa,can remove carbon dioxide at 536&#176;C,but kiln gases contain perhaps 35% CO 2,and would decompose pure calcite only above 829&#176;C.In reality,in a kiln burning a normal cement rawmix,decomposition begins at around 650&#176;C.
