## Types
After the compiler has a reference to the assembly,you can declare variables (and constants) of the types declared in that assembly in source code.For more information,see.NET Class Library.The common type system.It is important to understand two fundamental points about the type system in.NET:.even if their elemenTypes of Gear ~ Mechanical EngineeringGeared devices can change the speed,torque,and direction of a power source.Gears almost always produce a change in torque,creating a mechanical advantage,through their gear ratio,and thus may be considered a simple machine.There are many types of gears such as spur gears,helical gears,bevel gears,worm gears,gear rack,etc.
