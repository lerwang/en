The artisanal small scale gold mining (ASGM) sector exposes miners to toxic mercury when they use the chemical to extract gold from ore.However,with the right policies and market incentives,ASGM presents an opportunity to fight mercury use and contamination,protecting miners' health and the environment at the same time.The Global Environment Facility (GEF) is looking to do just that.The functions of lime in water treatmentThe functions of lime in water treatment Lime in all its forms quicklime and hydrated lime,as well as calcined dolomite are the most effective and cost efficient alkaline products used in the making of drinking water,as well as in the treatment of waste water and sludge.as well as in the treatment of waste water and sludge.

## Hydrated Lime Calcium Hydroxide Kemcore
Hydrated lime is a key industrial chemical used for pH control or regulation in a variety of processes.In the mining industry it finds use in pH regulation in gold cyanidation,stabilizing the cyanide complex by prevent formation of hydrogen cyanide.It is also a very good pH regulator in the flotation of a variety of minerals.How Is Mercury Used to Purify Gold? SciencingUnfortunately,a large amount of the mercury vaporized in the mining of gold and silver eventually found its way to the atmosphere or was dumped in waterways with other mine waste.It is estimated that about half of the mercury produced in human history was used.
