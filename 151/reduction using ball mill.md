## Ball mill
A ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind,blend and sometimes for mixing of materials for use in mineral dressing processes,paints,pyrotechnics,ceramics and selective laser sintering.It works on the principle of impact and attrition: size reduction is done by impact as the balls drop from near the top of the shell.A ball mill consists of a hollow cMill (grinding)SAG is an acronym for semi autogenous grinding.SAG mills are autogenous mills that also use grinding balls like a ball mill.A SAG mill is usually a primary or first stage grinder.SAG mills use a ball charge of 8 to 21%.The largest SAG mill is 42' (12.8m) in diameter,powered by a 28 MW (38,000 HP) motor.

&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;In roller mills,the principle of attrition is used where material is sheared as it passes through a gap and is transferred from slower roll to a faster roll,and is removed by a scraper.In ball mill,size reduction is done by both impact and attrition of particles.Rod mill is similar to ball mills but it uses long rods for grinding media.Daigarm Of Ball Mill Use For Siz Reductiondaigarm of ball mill use for siz reduction 2018 Hot Sale Grinder Mill,Zenith Vertical Raymond Mill For Sale.latest paten

## Ball Mill: Operating principles,components,Uses.
A ball mill also known as pebble mill or tumbling mill is a milling machine that consists of a hallow cylinder containing balls; mounted on a metallic frame such that it can be rotated along its longitudinal axis.The balls which could be of different diameter occupy 30 50% of the mill volume and its size depends on the feed and mill size.size reduction using ball millBall mill Wikipedia.A ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind,blend and sometimes for mixing of materials for use in mineral dressing processes,paints,pyrotechnics,ceramics and selective laser sintering.It works on the principle of impact and attrition: size reduction is done by impact as the balls drop from near the top of the shell.

## Mill (grinding)
SAG is an acronym for semi autogenous grinding.SAG mills are autogenous mills that also use grinding balls like a ball mill.A SAG mill is usually a primary or first stage grinder.SAG mills use a ball charge of 8 to 21%.The largest SAG mill is 42' (12.8m) in diameter,poweredSize reduction by millingA typical ball mill has a cylin drical shell slowly turning about a horizontal axis.The shell is filled to about half its volume with a solid grinding medium.The grinding medium can be metal rods,chains or balls.In a ball mill,most of the size reduction is done by impact as the bal
