## Gold extraction
Gold miners excavate an eroded bluff with jets of water at a placer mine in Dutch Flat,California sometime between 18.Gold extraction refers to the processes required to extract gold from its ores.This may require a combination of comminution,mineral processing,hydrometallurgical,and pyrometallurgical processes to be performed on the ore.Milling Process Definition,Milling Manufacturing ProcessesMilling machining is one of the very common manufacturing processes used in machinery shops and industries to manufacture high precision products and parts in different shapes and siz Introduction to Milling : Milling machine is one of the important machining operations In this operation the workpiece is fed against a rotating cylindrical tool
