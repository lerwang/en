## Ball Mill
Ball mills give a controlled final grind and produce flotation feed of a uniform size.Ball mills tumble iron or steel balls with the ore.The balls are initially 5 10 cm diameter but gradually wear away as grinding of the ore proceeds.The feed to ball mills (dry basis) is typically 75 vol. % ore and 25% steel.AMIT 135: Lesson 7 Ball Mills & Circuits Mining Mill.Ball Mill Operation.Ball mills ride on steel tires or supported on both ends by trunnions.Girth gears bolted to the shell drive the mill through a pinion shaft from a prime mover drive.The prime movers are usually synchronized motors.During rotation,a portion of the charge is lifted along the inside perimeter.
