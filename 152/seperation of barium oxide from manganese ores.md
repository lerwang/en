## Extraction of Gold
With pyritic ores a preliminary roasting to eliminate sulphur is necessary.The ore is reduced to a fine state of division and amalgamated simultaneously in a stamp mill,the solid gold amalgam separated from the liquid mercury by filtration through leather under pressure,and the mercury distilled.Water Research Center7&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Barium is a lustrous,machinable metal which exists in nature only in ores containing mixtures of elements.Barium is a naturally occurring alkaline earth metal more commonly found in the Midwest or in brine water or fluids associated with oil and gas development.
