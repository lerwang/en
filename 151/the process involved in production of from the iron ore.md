## Steel manufacture
31&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Iron is manufactured in a blast furnace.First,iron ore is mixed with coke and heated to form an iron rich clinker called ‘sinter’.Sintering is an important part of the overall process as it reduces waste and provides an efficient raw material for iron making.Coke is produced from carefully selected grades of coal.Different grades of.Control of Pollution in the Iron and Steel Industry16&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The iron and steel industry causes significant effects on environmental media air.The main types of plants involved in iron and steel industry are sintering plants,blast furnaces and steel works,direct reduction plants,ferroalloy production,rolling,scarfing.iron ore,coke breeze,limestone,mill scale,and flue dust into an.

## Iron Ore Mining Techniques,Metal Extraction,Types …
Iron ores are rocks and mineral deposits from which clanging iron can be reasonably extracted.Iron ore mining is classified into two categories manual mining and mechanized mining methods.Haematite and magnetite are the most commonly found iron ore minerals.Deposits of iron ore such as haematite containing iron oxide are found in sedimentary rocks from which the oxygen is removed from the.Copper Mining and Processing: Processing of Copper …Copper processing is a complicated process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper called cathodes,which will ultimately be made into products for everyday use.The most common types of ore,copper oxide and copper sulfide,undergo two different processes,hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy,respectively,due to the different.
