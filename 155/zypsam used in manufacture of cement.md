## Cement
Cement powder,here conditioned in bag,is mixed with fine and coarse aggregates and water.A cement is a binder,a substance used for construction that sets,hardens,and adheres to other materials to bind them together.Cement is seldom used on its own,but rather to bind sand and gravel (aggregate) together.Cement mixed with fine aggregate.Manufacturing process Lafarge in South AfricaDuring this phase,different mineral materials,called &quot;cement additives&quot;,may be added alongside the gypsum.Used in varying proportions,these additives,which are of natural or industrial origin,give the cement specific properties such as reduced permeability,greater resistance to sulfates and aggressive environments,improved workability,or higher quality finishes.
