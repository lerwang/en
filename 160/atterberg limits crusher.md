## Atterberg limits
The Atterberg limits are a basic measure of the critical water contents of a fine grained soil: its shrinkage limit,plastic limit,and liquid limit.Depending on its water content,a soil may appear in one of four states: solid,semi solid,plastic and liquid.In each state,the consistency and behavior of a soil is different and consequently so aSoil Stabilization using Crusher Dusttest,particle size distribution and Atterberg limit tests are conducted and the weakest sample is found among the four samples based on the test results.B.Crusher dust.Crusher dust was taken from Padalur M sand unit.The properti
