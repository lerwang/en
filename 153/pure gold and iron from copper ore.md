## Iron oxide copper gold ore deposits
Iron oxide copper gold ore deposits (IOCG) are important and highly valuable concentrations of copper,gold and uranium ores hosted within iron oxide dominant gangue assemblages which share a common genetic origin.These ore bodies range from around 10 million tonnes of contained ore,to 4,000 million tonnes or more,and have a grade of.Copper Production: How Is Copper Made?Copper processing is a complex process that involves many steps as the manufacturer processes the ore from its raw,mined state into a purified form for use in many industries.Copper is typically extracted from oxide and sulfide ores that contain between 0.5 and 2.0% copper.
