## Horsepower calculation
In order to calculate horsepower,it is necessary to determine the resultant force (R) due to the weight (W) acting at incline angle (a) Force (R) equals Weight (W) multiplied by sine (a) Sines of common incline angles are listed in weights and tabl The force (T) required to move the load is the sum of the resultant force (R),plus the.How to Determine Short Circuit Current RatingsIt’s important to understand short circuit current ratings (SCCR) for industrial control panels.Industrial control panel is a general term that describes an assembly of two or more components that can be power,control or both,but doesn’t include the controlled equipment.UL 508A,the UL Standard for Safety for Industrial Control Pan
