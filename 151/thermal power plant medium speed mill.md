## Thermal power station
A thermal power station is a power station in which heat energy is converted to electric power.In most places the turbine is steam driven.Water is heated,turns into steam and spins a steam turbine which drives an electrical generator.After it passes through the turbine the steam is condensed in a condenser and recycled to where it was heated.This is known as a Rankine cycle.Power Plants and Types of Power Plant Electrical4U8&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;A thermal power station or a coal fired thermal power plant is by far,the most conventional method of generating electric power with reasonably high efficiency.It uses coal as the primary fuel to boil the water available to superheated steam for driving the steam turbine.The steam turbine is then mechanically coupled to an alternator rotor.
