## Manganese Ore Processing
4&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Manganese is a critical mineral in America and the development of new methods of beneficiation is highly desirable for our national defenses.While much investigational work has been carried out by the U.S.Bureau of Mines and others,there is still a need for more efficient reagents to make many ores economically amenable to the flotation process.Beneficiation of Manganese Ore Using Froth Flotation.Scope for future work The extensive studies are carried out on a method for flotation of low grade Manganese Ore.Froth flotation is the process generally recommended for the beneficiation of low and medium grade ores because of the floatability characteristics of the manganese.
