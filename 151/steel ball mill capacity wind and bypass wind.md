## How much coal goes into a wind turbine? Debunk House
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Now a coal fired plant has a capacity factor of ~87% and a typical wind turbine only manages ~25%.So it takes about 3.5 MW of wind power to generate as much electricity as 1 MW of coal power,assuming the wind blows.So,it takes about 1,020 tons of coal to offset 1 MW of coal fired capacity with 1 MW of wind capacity.The Real Cost Of Wind Power NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE KNOW …&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;The real cost of wind energy,based on the lie that CO2 is a pollutant,is the loss of our coal,steel,and aluminium industries.Other high energy users will follow,and the aim of the United Nations to de industrialise the developed nations will at least be successful in the UK.

## Proper Steam Bypass System Design Avoids Steam Turbine.
The steam bypass system is generally used during the following modes of operation: start up and shutdown,steam turbine trip,steam turbine no load or low load operation,and simple cycle operation.Wind EnergyA wind turbine’s main gearbox serves to convert low rotor speed into high generator speed.The gearboxes commonly used in megawatt class turbines consist of one or two planetary stages and one or two spur gear stages.Operating conditions for wind turbines make high demands of the bearings used for the individual shafts and gearbox components.

## Windmill
A windmill is a structure that converts wind power into rotational energy by means of vanes called sails or blades,specifically to mill grain (),but the term is also extended to windpumps,wind turbines and other applications.Windmills were used throughout the high medieval and early modern periods; the horizontal or panemone windmill first appeared in Greater Iran during the 9th century.ASME B31.3 Process Piping Guide1&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;LANL Engineering Standards Manual PD342 Chapter 17 Pressure Safety Section D B31.G,ASME B31.3 Process Piping Guide Rev.2,3 10 09 4 The Owner and Designer are responsible for compliance with the personnel and process qualification requirements of the codes and standards.In particular,the application of ASME B31.3 requires compliance with the Inspector qualification
