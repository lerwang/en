## Perfecting the Performance of Secondary Crushers E & MJ
Cone crushers are fed with pre screened material from the primary crusher (usually a jaw crusher or primary gyratory),and the secondary crusher should always,if possible,have a scalped feed Ideally,the deck on the scalping screen should have a cut point equal to the closed side setting (CSS) of the crusherTechnology improvements of crushing process in Majdanpek,Mar 01,1996&#0183;&#32;The liner wear is reduced and the energy utilization for comminution (Grujiet al,1988) is increased by significant improvements on crushers and applied crushing flow sheet wilh the same number of crushers in secondary and tertiary crushing,as well as screen placing in front of the tertiary crushing and closing of crushing circuit in order to.
