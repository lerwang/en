## How is Potash Mined? Canpotex
The majority of Saskatchewan potash is mined by the conventional mining method,where large mining machines are used to extract the ore by cutting tunnels into the ore body.The raw ore is then conveyed to a production hoist where it is transferred to the surface for processing.Dry ProcessingSustainability: For the dry treatment,no water (from the environment) is required to process the extracted ore; thus,there is no need to build tailings dams.In comparison to the wet processing,the dry processing technique reduces.
