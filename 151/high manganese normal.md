## Maxing Out On Manganese?
Manganese is a mineral that we need in small amounts for normal growth and good health.It is a constituent of some of the enzymes in our bodies and an activator of other enzymes,some of which play key roles in the metabolism of carbohydrates,amino acids and cholesterol.Manganese2 &ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Manganese status is difficult to assess and not routinely measured in clinical practice.Normal whole blood concentrations of manganese range from 4 to 15 mcg L [ 1 ],but they are highly variable,and their utility as a status indicator is unclear [ 4 ].Some studies that measured serum or plasma manganese concentrations in apparently healthy.
