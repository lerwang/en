The Middle Stone Age (MSA) comprises a diverse group of African industries characterized by the absence or rarity of large cutting tools (LCTs,such as Acheulean handaxes and cleavers),the presence of prepared core (Levallois) technologies,and regional and or temporal variation in weapon armatures (1 3).Later MSA industries contain varying frequencies of small retouched bladelets and.Evidence of hunting and hafting during the Middle Stone Age at.A detailed examination of the ochre distribution on the points confirmed that ochre was also part of the hafting arrangement.The need to use a dependable methodology for the recognition of hunting and hafting traces on stone points from the southern African Middle Stone Age context is briefly discussed.
