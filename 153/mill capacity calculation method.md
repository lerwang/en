## Mill sizing method
Please find below two calculators for sizing mills using the Bond and Rowland methods: Ball mill sizing: Calculator for ball mill(s) in a single stage circuit.Rod ball mill sizing: Calculator for rod mill(s) as first stage of the circuit and ball mill(s)Calculate OEE Definitions,Formulas,and Examples OEESimple Calculation.The simplest way to calculate OEE is as the ratio of Fully Productive Time to Planned Production Time.Fully Productive Time is just another way of saying manufacturing only Good Parts as fast as possible (Ideal Cycle Time) with no Stop Time.Hence the calculation is: OEE = (Good Count &#215; Ideal Cycle Time) Planned.
