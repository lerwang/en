## How is Steel Produced? World Coal Association
Steel is an alloy based primarily on iron.Coking coal is converted to coke by driving off impurities to leave almost pure carbon.a blast furnace is fed with the iron ore,coke and small quantities of fluxes (minerals,such as limestone,whichNPTEL :: Mechanical Engineering Manufacturing Processes ICupola furnaces are tall,cylindrical furnaces used to melt iron and ferrous alloys in foundry operations.Alternating layers of metal and ferrous alloys,coke,and limestone are fed into the furnace from the top.
