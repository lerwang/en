Polyphosphate is a type of salt or ester of polymeric oxyanion formed from tetrahedral PO4 (phosphate) structural units connected together by sharing oxygen atoms.Polyphosphates can have linear or cyclic ring structures.In water treatment general orthophosphate and polyphosphate are used.Reverse osmosis14&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Reverse osmosis (RO) is a water purification process that uses a partially permeable membrane to remove ions,unwanted molecules and larger particles from drinking water.In reverse osmosis,an applied pressure is used to overcome osmotic pressure,a colligative property that is driven by chemical potential differences of the solvent,a thermodynamic parameter.

## Corrosion tables — Sandvik Materials Technology
The corrosion data in this section is mainly based on the results of general corrosion laboratory tests,which are not strictly comparable with actual service conditions.The corrosion tables provide an initial guide to the selection of materials and are intended to facilitate understanding of the different types of corrosion damage that can arise due to poor material selection.Scale problems in productionThe onset of water production coinciding with simultaneous reduction in oil production is a sign of potential scale problems.It is quite possible,particularly with gas wells,to produce water below the limit of detection of surface analysis (nominally 1 or 2%).
