## How Does A Concrete Batch Plant Work Aimix Construction,
Jun 23,2020&#0183;&#32;Concrete Batching Plant Process Flow The work flow of the concrete mixing plant consists of four parts: weighing and feeding of sand and gravel,weighing and feeding of powder (cement,fly ash,etc),weighing and feeding of water and admixture,mixing and storage After the mixer control system is powered on,it enters the operation interface.Batching,Mixing,Transporting,and Handling Concrete,Batching is the process of measuring concrete mix ingre dients by either mass or volume and introducing them into the mixer To produce concrete of uniform quality,the ingredients must be measured accurately for each batch Most specifications require that batching be done by mass rather than by volume (ASTM C 94 or AASHTO M 157)
