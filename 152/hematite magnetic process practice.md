Its application in lean hematite and magnetic iron ore concentrators has raised the iron concentrate grade to TFe 67.5% and TFe 69.5% and reduced the SiO2 content to less than 4%.TFe67.5%Is Hematite Magnetic Orgone Energy AustraliaIs Hematite Magnetic? Hematite is not magnetic and shouldn’t respond to a common magnet.However,there are many hematite specimens containing enough magnetite which makes them attracted to a common magnet.This usually leads to a wrong assumption that the piece is magnetite or pyrrhotite,which is weakly magnetic.So,it is important to check other properties to ensure an accurate.
