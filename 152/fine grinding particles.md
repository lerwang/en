High grinding capabilities.For example,in the case of grinding toner,50% cost reduction (comparing energy consumption ratio) can be expected relative to conventional jet mills. For high grade,high added value of products. Easy particle size control. Easy Maintenance and Inspection. …Energy Use of Fine Grinding in Mineral Processing.In fine grinding,a material with an F80 of less than 100 μm is comminuted to a P80 of 7 to 30 μm.(P80s of 2 μm are at least claimed by equipment manufacturers.)The feed is typically a flotation concentrate,which is reground to liberate fine particles of the value mineral.
