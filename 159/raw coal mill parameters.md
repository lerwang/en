## Process control optimization of rotary kiln line,raw mill.
During the first phase of optimisation at the Adana plant,EO was designed to control the kiln,calciner and clinker cooler with three modules.After the performance tests and final acceptance of EO system for these process areas,two further modules were added for the raw meal mill and coal mill.Coal Hang up in Bowl Mill OperationsThere are many types of mills and bowl mill is one of them,all these mills can face coal hang up.For taking corrective action during a coal hang up in bowl mills the operator will have to know the reason for such a hang up,how the plant will respond,what he has to respond to and what the local operator will have to do.This will reduce the chance of mill trip and bring back boiler to.
