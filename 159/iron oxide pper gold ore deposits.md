Abstract.Many diverse ore systems are classified together as iron oxide copper gold (lOCG) deposits based on an empirical definition arising primarily from geochemical features that do not specify tectonic setting,geologic environment,or sources of ore forming fluid,metals,or other ore components.Copper Mining and Extraction Sulfide OresThe world's largest copper ore deposits are found in Chile on the west coast of South America.This is due to the volcanic activity that is part of the process that created the Andes mountain chain.Elimination of iron sulfide by oxidation to iron oxide which forms a slag: 2FeS(l) + 3O 2 + SiO2(l) Gold,silver,platinum and tin are
