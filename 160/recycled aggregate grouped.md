2020 1 31&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Window functions.A window function is a variation on an aggregation function.Where an aggregation function,like sum() and mean(),takes n inputs and return a single value,a window function returns n values.The output of a window function depends on all its input values,so window functions don’t include functions that work element wise,like + or round().Aggregates22&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Sources for these basic materials can be grouped into three main areas: Mining of mineral aggregate deposits,including sand,gravel,and stone.Waste slag from the manufacture of iron and steel.Recycled materials,which are chiefly manufactured from mineral aggregates.
