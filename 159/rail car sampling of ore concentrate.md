## MARC Technologies &#187; Metal Concentrate Spear Sampler
Metal Concentrate Spear Sampler MARC’s spear sampler for ore or metal concentrates is designed for penetrating stockpiles or bags of high SG powders.Most spear samplers are derived from products designed for grain,maize corn or pharmaceutical (organic.Experimental validation of a primary sampling system for …a complete column of ore with nominal top size less than 1 mm shall be extracted when sampling iron ore concentrate in a wagon.Principles and general requirements for checking sampling bias The method for checking for sampling bias is to compare the online stream sampling system (Figure 1) to a reference sampling method considered to produce true and unbiased results.

## SAMPLING FOR MINERAL PROCESSING Part 1 in a series
Objectives of Sampling • Process Control Normally for concentrate and tailings of each stage of the flotation process Requires sampling to verify tendencies in the process Important for maximizing metal recoveries Feed for On Stream (OSA) and Particle SizeCORESampling efficiency refers to understanding the loss of information when sampling a certain volume out of a complex population such as a stirred pulp.Changes in the physical and chemical conditions of the sample may lead to measurement biases particularly in the sealed devices; the physical mechanisms occurring during sampling are also evaluated.
