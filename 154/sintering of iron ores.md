## 125 Iron And Steel Production
Iron is produced in blast furnaces by the reduction of iron bearing materials with a hot gas The large,refractory lined furnace is charged through its top with iron as ore,pellets,and or sinter; flux as limestone,dolomite,and sinter; and coke for fuel Iron oxides,coke and fluxes react with theWhat Is Iron Ore Sintering?
