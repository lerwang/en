## The cement kiln
Quite a few wet process kilns are still in operation,usually now with higher tech bits bolted on.However,new cement kilns are of the 'dry process' type.Dry process kilns.In a modern works,the blended raw material enters the kCement Manufacturing Process Phases Flow Chart.Generally cement plants are fixed where the quarry of limestone is near bye.This saves the extra fuel cost and makes cement somehow economical.Raw materials are extracted from the quarry and by means of conveyor belt material is transported to the cement plant.There are also various other raw materials used for cement manufacturing.
