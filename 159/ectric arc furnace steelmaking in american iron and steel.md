## Steel Steelmaking Iron
The electric arc furnace is by far the most popular e lectric steelmaking furnace.The carbon arc was discovered by Sir Humphry Davy i n 1800,but it had no practical application in steelmaking until Sir William Sie mens of open hearth fame constructed,operated,and patented furnaces operating on both direct and indirect arc principles in 1878.Nuclear Power in an Age of Uncertainty February 1984 …Nuclear Power in an Age of Uncertainty February 1984 NTIS order #PB 183953.advertisement.
