## IRON AND STEEL
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;This page looks at the use of the Blast Furnace in the extraction of iron from iron ore,and the conversion of the raw iron from the furnace into various kinds of steel.The common ores of iron are both iron oxides,and these can be reduced to iron by heating them with carbon in the form of coke.Iron gall inkIron gall ink (also known as common ink,standard ink,oak gall ink or iron gall nut ink) is a purple black or brown black ink made from iron salts and tannic acids from vegetable sources.It was the standard ink formulation used in Europe for the fourteen hundred year period between the 5th and 19th centuries,remained in widespread use well into the 20th century,and is still sold today.

## Iron
Iron is a chemical element and a metal.It is the second most common metal on Earth,and the most widely used metal.It makes up much of the Earth's core,and is the fourth most common element in the Earth's crust.The metal is used a lot because it is strong and cheap.Iron is the main ingredient used to make steel.Raw iron is magnetic.The BalanceToday,steel production makes use of recycled materials as well as traditional raw materials,such as iron ore,coal,and limestone.Two processes,basic oxygen steelmaking (BOS) and electric arc furnaces (EAF),account for virtually all steel production.
