## recovery of copper from oxide copper ore by flotation and leaching
2 Dec 2014.The aim of this study was the recovery of copper from the oxide copper ore by froth flotation and agitating sulphuric acid (H2SO4) leaching.The ore with 4.21% copper grade used in this study was obtained from Çorum Dangaz region of Turkey.Native copper,cuprite (Cu2O),tenorite (CuO),and malachite&nbsp;.WO2018184071A1A method of leaching copper containing ores,such as chalcopyrite ores,with a leach liquor in the presence of silver and an activation agent that activates silver whereby the silver enhances copper extraction from copper ores.

## Primary Copper Ore Leaching by Leaching Solution …
Copper ore is classified into three groups; primary copper sulfide,copper oxide and secondary copper sulfide.Leaching copper from primary copper sulfide,such as chalcopyrite,with sulfuric acid takes longer time than from copper oxide and secondary copper.
