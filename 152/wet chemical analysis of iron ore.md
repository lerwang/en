## Quantitative phase analysis of iron ore concentrates
The quantification of goethite,magnetite,martite and specularite in iron ores was successfully achieved by a combination of wet chemical analysis and x ray diffraction.It was found that the intensity of the goethite (111) peak is constant for a certain sample provided that the same sample holder is used.CHAPTER FUNDAMENTALS OF IRON ORE SINTERING16&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;CHAPTER FUNDAMENTALS OF IRON ORE SINTERING R.P.Bhagat INTRODUCTION.variability in physical and chemical properties,sinter is produced in the plant whose.Wet Zone: This lowest portion of the bed has essentially the same characteristics as the original mix.The gas stream has transferred essentially all its sensible heat to
