## Ore Melting and Reduction in Silicomanganese Production,
The charge for silicomangansese production consists of manganese ore (often mixed with ferromanganese slag) dolomite or calcite,quartz,and in some cases,other additions These materials have different melting properties,which have a strong effect on reduction and smelting reactions in the production of a silicomanganese alloyAn Improved Process for the Production of Low Carbon,Jun 04,2020&#0183;&#32;There are three methods to produce the LC FeMn They are (1) decarburization of HC FeMn,(2) aluminothermic reduction of manganese ore,and (3) silicothermic reduction of manganese ore All these methods involve exothermic reactions The decarburization of HC FeMn entails top or bottom blowing of oxygen into the molten HC FeMn in a converter
