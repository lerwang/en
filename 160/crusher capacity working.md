## What is a Jaw Crusher? MEKA Crushing Equipment
The working principle of jaw crushers is based on the reciprocating movement of the movable jaw that compresses and crushes the rock or ore between itself and the fixed jaw,as the material enters the zone between the jaws,A comparison of jaw crushers with the same capacity reveals that double toggle jaw crushers are more expensive than.TECHNICAL NOTES 5 CRUSHERSThe capacity of the crusher is determined by its size.The gape determines the maximum size of material that can be accepted.Maximum size that can be accepted into the crusher is approximately 80% of the gape.Jaw crushers are operated to produce a size reduction ratio between 4:1 and 9:1.Gyratory crushers
