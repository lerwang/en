## How grinding wheel is made
A grinding wheel is a wheel composed of an abrasive compound and used for various grinding (abrasive cutting) and abrasive machining operations.Such wheels are used in grinding machines.The wheels are generally made from a composite material consisting of coarse particle aggregate pressed and bonded together by a cementing matrix (called the.Refining Approaches to Corrective and Preventive Rail …The CSX grinding program uses a tonnage based frequency with a weighted average for different segment lengths; the grinding frequency for curves varies,depending on the degree of curvature.CSX typically grinds tangent segments at between 50 and 70 MGT
