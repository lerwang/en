## Spray (liquid drop)
A spray is a dynamic collection of drops dispersed in a gas.[1] The process of forming a spray is known as atomization.A spray nozzle is the device used to generate a spray.The two main uses of sprays are to distribute material over a cross section and to generate liquid surface area.There are thousands of applications in which sprays allow.Effective Temperature Control for Cement Kiln Off Gasesmany cement plants with state of the art evaporative spray technology.Gas temperatures have elevated in recent years from as low as 180°C to over 370°C.This is coincident with a higher proportion of "dry" operation kilns.Evaporative cooling water sprays in conditioning towers,ducts or at the kiln exit have proven an effective alternative

2017 5 5&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Commencing 1 January 2016 Adelaide Brighton Cement Ltd will apply,using a dedicated water truck cart,a road stabilisation agent to all unsealed surfaces around the site,as required,to ensure fugitive dust is minimised from these areas (this may be more frequently undertaken in warm and or windy conditions).ConferencesThe cost of using the water sprays is a fraction of the cost of using air blowers,and is quiet enough to be used in plants that are surrounded by residential areas.At the start of the final session,on logistics optimisation,Paul Flachskampf of INFORM spoke about improving the connection between production,the loading yard and cement distribution.

## A New Look at Evaporative Gas Cooling and Conditioning …
Abstract: Although evaporative coolers and conditioners have existed in the cement industry for many years,they have been a constant source of problems that cause plant managers and filter manufacturers alike to fear the words ``water sprays.'' The reason is.Emissions from the Cement Industry · Its a fact that most of the cement industry experts know that this industry emit huge CO2 and also also they have found some alternative fuels also,but still lot of natural resources are wasted which can reduce clinker percentage of a cement,We have to address general public in a simple language which we can educate them about cement types which have developed with less clinker.
