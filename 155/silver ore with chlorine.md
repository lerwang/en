## recovery of gold from ores with chlorine in 1898
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;I would like to begin a discussion of the various ways of leaching gold with chlorine and the similarities between them.I would first like to re post the post that first started me wondering about the possibility of using a chlorine leach with an iron rich ore.Here,once.Leaching of an oxide gold ore with chloride hypochlorite,An oxide gold ore was subjected to chloride hypochlorite leaching at room temperature,Chlorine had been used to dissolve gold from ores and concentrates,during the second half of the 19th century in Australia and North America,Puvvada and Murthy (2000) used chloride hypochlorite solution to leach gold and silver from a chalcopyrite.

## Copper silver ionization as a disinfectant Lenntech
Silver can be obtained from pure deposits,from silver ores such as argenite (Ag 2 S) and horn silver (AgCl) and combined with ore deposites that contain lead,gold or copper,This can be brought about by a combination of copper silver ionization and chlorine disinfection Chlorine concentrations that are required are much lowerAdvances in Gold and Silver Processingcarbonaceous refractory gold ore in Nevada with hypochlorite followed by cyanidation Gold extraction was improved from 6 32 % to more than 90% The reagent requirement in the pretreatment stage was initially 15 kg of chlorine per tonne of ore and then

Chlorine,generally prepared by the interaction of pyrolusite,salt and sulphuric acid,is led from a suitable generator beneath the false bottom,and rises through the moistened ore,which rests on a bed of broken quartz; the gold is thus converted into a solubleCopper,Silver and Gold University of DenverCopper,Silver and Gold Contents The Royal Family; Copper;,and some of the ore,so different in appearance from metallic copper,was reduced Copper was the first metal whose ores were mined,and some of the earliest mines have left traces,as in the Sinai peninsula,There is also a chlorine process,where the gold dissolves as AuCl 2.

## Gold Ore Chlorination Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
II Gold Ore Roasting: When the analysis was complete,some of the ore was chlorinated in a manner to be explained later,and it was found that no practically important extraction could be obtained,due to the fact that the sulphur absorbed a large part of the chlorine and that the gold was not in a suitable form to be attacked by chlorine
