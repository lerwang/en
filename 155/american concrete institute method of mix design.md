shotcrete mix design is divided into wet mix and gunite to dry mix.This article focuses on the target mix design of shotcrete.The bulk density of wet sprayed concrete can be 2300 kg m 3,The weight ratio of cement to sandstone is preferably 1.0: 3.5 to 1.0.CONCRETE MIX DESIGN CONCEPTThis method of proportioning was first published in 1944 by ACI committee 613.In 1954 the method was revised to include,among other modifications,the use of entrained air.In 1970,the method of ACI mix design became the responsibility of ACI committee 211.
