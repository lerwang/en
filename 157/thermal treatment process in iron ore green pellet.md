## CORE
Abstract.Sintering occurs in many types of material such as iron,ceramics and snow,typically during thermal treatment,and aects the material properties,particularly the strength,by the bonding of particles into a coherent structure.Understanding Pellets and Pellet Plant Operations …Understanding Pellets and Pellet Plant Operations.Pelletizing is an agglomeration process which converts very fine grained iron ore into balls of a certain diameter range (normally 8mm to 20 mm,also known as pellets.These pellets are suitable for blast furnace and direct reduction processes.
