## Cement Industry in India 2019
2020 3 3&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;India accounts for ~8% of the global cement production installed capacity.In FY 2018,India held the second position in the global cement industry,with a production volume of 297.56 Mn tons in comparison to China’s 2170 Mn tons.The cement industry in India is supported by high FDI.Energy Consumption in Production of ConcreteThe production of 1 m&#179; of concrete requires 2,775 MJ of energy.This energy comes mostly from oil burning,which generates CO2.2.775 MJ of energy is produced by 0.37 barrels of oil.Saving concrete,e.g.by adopting appropriate building solutions,means therefore not only reducing fossil fuels consumption,but also pollutant emissions.
