## Gear cutting Machine Article about Gear cutting …
A gear cutting machine is used to rough out and finish gear teeth,to fit gears,and to fine finish and round off the butt ends of gear teeth.Gear milling machines are used to make spur,helical,and herringbone gears,as well as worm gears.Machining spur gears without an A axis or rotary table?So I want to make some gears,specifically &quot;reduction double spur gears&quot; that look something like this Ideally I'd like to make them from brass.I have a manual lathe with no indexing capability,and a 3 axis CNC vertical milling machine.No A axis or rotary table.

## What is a milling machine?
Milling is the machining process of using rotary cutters to remove material from a workpiece by advancing (or feeding) in a direction at an angle with the axis of the tool.It covers a wide variety of different operations and machines,on scales from small individual parts to large,heavy duty gang milling operations.Machining Gears&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;What few gears I've made were last resort.The cutters aren't cheap,but when it's either a cutter,or a gear that's custom cut and an OEM wants 10X the money the cutter costs,then,well it's feasible.On ordinary gears,I've always bought them.
