## Magnetic Separator
The design of drum magnetic separators is basically the same,with permanent magnet blocks arranged in a stationary position inside a nonmagnetic rotating drum.However,there are three basic designs for the tank of drum,according to the directions of drum rotation and slurry flow,that is,concurrent,counterrotation,and countercurrent ( Svoboda,2004 ).Magnetic separationMagnetic separation is the process of separating components of mixtures by using magnets to attract magnetic materials.[1] The process that is used for magnetic separation detaches non magnetic material with those who are magnetic.This technique is useful for not all,but few minerals such as ferromagnetic (materials strongly affected by.
