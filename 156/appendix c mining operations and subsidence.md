## Subsidence
Subsidence is the sudden sinking or gradual downward settling of the ground's surface with little or no horizontal motion.The definition of subsidence is not restricted by the rate,magnitude,or area involved in the downward movement.It may be caused by natural processes or by human activities.The former include various karst phenomena.Appendix B: Permit Application ChecklistA map of underground operations which describes areas where planned subsidence will be employed.30 C.F.R.784.20(b)(2).Description of physical conditions (for example,depth of cover,seam thickness,etc.) which may affect subsidence damage.30 C.F
