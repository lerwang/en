## feature Specifying Fly Ash for Use in Concrete
60 ı SPRING 2008 feature Specifying Fly Ash for Use in Concrete By Karthik H.Obla,Ph.D.P.E.Managing Director,Research &amp; Materials Engineering,NRMCA O ver the past several decades,the use of fly ash in concrete has had a successful track record.TheUses,Benefits,and Drawbacks of Fly Ash in ConstructionClass C fly ash is typically composed of high calcium fly ashes with a carbon content of less than 2 percent.Currently,more than 50 percent of the concrete placed in the U.S.contains fly ash.Dosage rates vary depending on the type of fly ash and its reactivity level.

The higher the carbon content in the fly ash,the more difficult it is to control the air content.Further,if the carbon content varies,air content must be closely monitored and admixture dosage rates changed to insure proper levels of air entrainment.Retarders.CONCRETE Optimizing the Use of Fly Ash in Concretehydration products.If the calcium content of the fly ash is high enough,it is possible to make concrete with moderate strength using the fly ash as the sole cementing material (Cross 2005).In addition to providing an indication of the mineralogy and reactivity of
