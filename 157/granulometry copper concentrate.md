## Should a ceramic filter be used downstream of a slurry.
The ceramic filter has the appearance and operating principle similar to that of the conventional rotary filter.But,the filter media,rather than a mesh (as in the conventional filter) is a ceramic plate of microporous structure that allows only the passage of liquid.That's why they become good choices for materials with high fines content.Angle of Material Recommended Material Density Repose.19&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Angle of Material Recommended.Material Density Repose Group Max.Inclination.Alfalfa,Meal 17 45&#176; 4.Alfalfa Pellets 43 29&#176; 2.Alfalfa Seed 15 29&#176; 2.*Copper ore 120 150 44&#176; 3 20.Copper sulfate 75 85 31&#176; 3 17.Copra,lumpy 22 20&#176; 2 9.
