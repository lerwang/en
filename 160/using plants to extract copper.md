 · Use stainless steel and glass parts,if possible.Do not use plastic tubing in place of a glass pipe,as it can affect the quality of the oil.Some plants react badly with copper,but heavily tinned copper is suitable in all cases.You can also use aluminum materials,but not with wintergreen,cloves,or other plants …Copper production & environmental impact• Copper is 100% recyclable without loss of quality • Copper is the most recycled metal after iron and aluminium • Around 40% of the demand for copper within Europe is supplied from recycled copper.• Recycling a tonne of copper uses 20% of the energy that would be used to mine and extract the same copper.

## Green synthesis of metal nanoparticles using plants.
The advantages of using plant and plant derived materials for biosynthesis of metal nanoparticles have interested researchers to investigate mechanisms of metal ions uptake and bioreduction by plants,and to understand the possible mechanism of metal nanoparticle formation in plants.Innovations: Introduction to Copper: Mining & ExtractionHowever,by far the greatest extension in the use of copper resulted from Michael Faraday's discovery of electromagnetic induction in 1831 and the way that the effect could be used to generate electricity.The same principle was used to develop electric motors.The electric lamp was invented by Sir Joseph Swan in 1860 and brought to a commercial design by Thomas Edison in 1879.
