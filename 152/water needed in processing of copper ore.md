## The Extraction of Copper
Copper can be extracted from non sulfide ores by a different process involving three separate stages: Reaction of the ore (over quite a long time and on a huge scale) with a dilute acid such as dilute sulfuric acid to produce a very dilute copper(II) sulfate solution.Concentration of the copper(II) sulfate solution by solvent extraction.Chapter 7 Energy Use in the Copper Industry20&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;MINERAL PROCESSING Grinding and concentration together consume about 45 percent of the energy used in the pro duction of cathode copper.Assuming an ore grade of 0.55 percent and a recovery rate of87.5 6.4 percent copper in the concentrate,concentrat ing 1 ton of copper ore requires over 200 billion Btu,or approximately 42 million Btu ton of.
