Use the grinding wheel if you want to grind out welds,clean up cuts,and prep metal for welding (since you need bare shiny metal to weld).Of the four wheels,this removes material the fastest.The grinding wheels above tend to gouge the material you're working on.We get right down to bare,shiny metal quickly.This wheel left some.&quot;Grinding&quot; down an aluminum weld bead?&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The down side is that they wear out faster than steel grinding disks.You definitely have to wear safety glasses and a face shield would be better (always a good idea in any case).There is also an additional debris clean up problem but they can really take off the material.I assume welding supply places have the aluminum grinding disks.

## Grind down plug welds on full floor replacement? …
&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;No grinding needed.Really.If you weld it hot enough you can fill the lil pocket up and the molten metal will lay flat.Now.If you are timid,and reduce the heat you will get alot of cold buildup that doesnt do anything for the weld joint.Just something to grind or sand down.Bump up the heat for the plug welds,they can take alot of heat.grinding down welds?grinding down welds? 2009,07:59 PM.Hello I am I am new to the board and I am wondering how many times can you grind down a weld and reweld on mild steel before it does something to the metal? Will it make it weaker?.One thing to make note of is that if you are grinding out entire welds,its a safe bet they were probably closer to.

## Pros of weldit,is it ever OK to grind welds? : Welding
I've been discussing with a friend of mine whether or not it's ever OK to grind your welds.I understand that grinding down a weld reduces it's strength,and therefore a structural weld should never be ground down.Does grinding a non structural weld for aesthetic reasons make you a bad welder? Is it ever OK to grind your welds?Grinding,smoothing welds The H.A.M.B.&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Grinding off a large amount of material makes the area hot and then wavy.You should be able to get your welds to the point where they only need a quick blast with 80 or 120 grit on a flap disc to flatten.Then finish with a rubber backed 180 grit.Dont use a grinding wheel on sheet metal.

## Eight tips for effective grinding
Just as different cutting tools are designed for different applications,different grinding discs are designed for different metals.For instance,some welds in high strength,abrasive resistant steels have been known to be ground down best with specialized discs that can “chisel” or “chew” away at the hard,high tensile weld metal.smoothing welds T Bucket Forums&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Bondo won't hack the temp.Be very careful when grinding the reinforcement off your welds.If the penetration is not very good due to the procedure or process you may be grinding away a lot of the strength.If I am going to vanity grind welds I make sure they have a good vee prep and the penetration is 100% i.e.the weld fuses the whole setup.

&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;However,all codes I am aware of have a clause where the inspector examiner can terminate a weld test if there are questions over the welders ability (eg.excessive grinding,grinding of every pass) I have personally performed hundreds of weld tests over the years ( ASME IX,BS EN287,AS NZS 3992,AWS D1.1,AS 1554,NZS 4711 both piping and.grinding sanding down welds?An angle grinder with normal grinding wheel to knock the tops off of the weld beads,switching to a flap disc to finish grinding the welds down and smoothing things out.The air die grinder with a cut off wheel has it's advantages (less heat build up) but is time consuming,it is best used in tight spots.

201318&ensp&#0183&enspI've noticed a few threads with references to grinding down the welds on the headers for a little bit of HP increase.Not sure which welds they are talking about.Also,why does grinding them down increase HP? Would like to know science behind something before I go grinding away.How to grind aluminum welds?WOW!! I just took a look! Thanks for all the replies!! All very helpfull! I should have been more specific.When I repair older alluminum castings,some times I have to grind out the weld and do it again,do to all the old oil and crap in the original casting,for me the grinding out never goes well,the stones load or just don't cut well,then I have to clean it all up again and weld again.
