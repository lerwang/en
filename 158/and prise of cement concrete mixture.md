## Concrete Mix Ratios
Concrete mix ratio is a vital topic in concrete mix design.The four basic ingredients for making concrete are: Portland cement,sand,aggregate (stone) and water.The strength of concrete mixture depends on the ratio in which these four ingredients are mixed.Concrete mixerA concrete mixer (often colloquially called a cement mixer) is a device that homogeneously combines cement,aggregate such as sand or gravel,and water to form concrete.A typical concrete mixer uses a revolving drum to mix the components.For smaller volume works,portable concrete mixers are often used so that the concrete can be made at the.

## Concrete: The Basic Mix
Another &quot;old rule of thumb&quot; for mixing concrete is 1 cement : 2 sand : 3 gravel by volume.Mix the dry ingredients and slowly add water until the concrete is workable.This mixture may need to be modified depending on the aggregate used to provide a concreteConcreteConcrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time.In the past limebased cement binders were often used,such as lime putty,but sometimes with other hydraulic cements,such as a calcium aluminate cement or with Portland cement to form Portland cement concrete (for its visual resemblance to.
