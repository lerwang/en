When copper is made from sulfide ores by the first method above,it is impure.The blister copper is first treated to remove any remaining sulfur (trapped as bubbles of sulfur dioxide in the copper hence &quot;blister copper&quot;) and then cast into anodes for refining using electrolysis.Blister CopperBlister copper is further refined as either fire refined copper or anode copper (99.5% pure copper),which is used in subsequent electrolytic refining.In fire refining,molten blister copper is placed in a fire refining furnace,a flux may be added,and air is blown through the molten mixture to remove residual sulfur.
