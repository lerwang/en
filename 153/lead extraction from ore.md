## Lead Ore
Lead Ore is an early game ore that generates upon world creation on the surface,as well as in the Underground and Cavern layers.Its primary use is in crafting Lead Bars,which can then be used to craft the Lead tier of tools,weapons,and armor,as well as Buckets,Chains,and several other items.and several other items.Lead processingLead processing Lead processing Mining and concentrating: Once the ore is removed from veins (narrow channels) or lodes (roughly spherical deposits) in the Earth,usually at depths of about 60 metres,the ore is treated at concentrating mills.Here the ore is.
