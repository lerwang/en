## Safety stock and reordering
Safety stock as a percentage of lead time demand When we previously wrote about the reorder point and safety stock,we had suggested the most common approach: estimating a safety stock level based on current demand.This involved multiplying the average.how do you calculate the percentage of an ore? Yahoo …&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;The percentage of either Lead or Sulfur is just the atomic weight divided by the molecular weight.If the ore contains just a fraction of PbS,multiply this fraction by the percent of either Pb or S.If the ore was 12% PbS,then the amount of Lead would be 12%.
