Sedimentation is the process in which particulate matter carried from its point of origin by either natural or humanenhanced processes is deposited elsewhere on land surfaces or in waterbodies.Sediment is a natural product of stream erosion; however,the sediment load may be increased by human practices.Schedule Of Proposed Action2&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;LEGAL Project is located at 4 locations: Big Canyon (sec.26,T40N.R4W),Everitt Hill (Sec.30,T40N.R3W),Snowman's Hill (Sec.33,T.40N.R3W) and along Highway 89 between Mt.Shasta and McCloud,California.This project is located between Mt.Shasta and McCloud,California along existing roads and powerline corridors at the locations noted.
