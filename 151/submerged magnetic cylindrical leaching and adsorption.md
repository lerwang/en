## Separation processes
20&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Separation processes are based on the theory of vapor liquid equilibrium.This theory states that streams leaving a stage in a separation process are in equilibrium with one another.The idea of equilibrium revolves around the idea that when there is vapor and liquid in contact with one another they are in constantly vaporizing and condensing.
