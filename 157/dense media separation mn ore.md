 · Feed for the dense media separation must be hard and compact with non porous gangue material.Heavy media cyclone The process is used for iron ore fines with size range of 0.2mm to 6 mm.The cyclone type separator utilizes centrifugal as well as gravitational forces to make separation between ore and gangue material.Crushing of diamond ore for dense media separationCrushing of diamond ore for dense media separation Dense Media Separation Plants Dense Media Separation DMS plants across the world make use of Ferrosilicon powders for the extraction of diamonds from waste diamond bearing material The fact that this.

## Dense Media Separation
Dense media separation processes find wide use.Prior to the development of complex DMS systems,separating valuable product from waste byproducts was challenging.Yet,DMS changed the refining process for any compound where the refined product varies in density from the unrefined product.The Scrap recyclers also apply the same process.Dense Heavy Medium Separation HMS DMS ProcessHMS and DMS are acronyms for Heavy (Dense) Medium Separation and is applied to the process of pre concentration of minerals mainly the production of a high weight,low assay product,which may be rejected as waste.In principle it is the simplest of all gravity.
