## Crusher
A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks,gravel,or rock dust.Crushers may be used to reduce the size,or change the form,of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled,or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore),so that pieces of different composition can.Nonlinear Material Behavior Analysis under High …Gun chamber pressure is an important parameter in proofing of ammunition to ensure safety and reliability.It can be measured using copper crushers or piezoelectric sensor.Pressure calculations in copper crusher method are based on linear plastic deformation of.

## Important Information About Shotshell Pressures
The current method adopted by SAAMI for shotshell pressure measurement is to use the piezoelectric transducer system and then to express pressures so measured in pounds per square inch (psi).The old way was to use the lead crusher system and express pressures in lead units of pressure (LUP).Copper units of pressureCopper units of pressure or CUP,and the related lead units of pressure or LUP,are terms applied to pressure measurements used in the field of internal ballistics for the estimation of chamber pressures in firearms.These terms were adopted by convention to indicate that the pressure values were measured by copper crusher and lead crusher gauges respectively.
