## How to Calculate Cutting Force Sciencing
You can perform a blade cutting force calculation to measure how strong your blade is.Use this equation to figure out the force required to cut paper and other materials.Engineers make sure blades are strong and durable enough for whatever they may be used for.Be safe so you don't get cut!Feed Rate CalculatorFeed Rate Calculator.When milling or drilling,or creating a tool path for a CNC machine the feed rate must be determined.Materials have rated surface speeds for a given type of cutter.The harder the material the slower the speed.Given the diameter of the tool and the surface speed,the RPMs of the spindle can be calculated.
