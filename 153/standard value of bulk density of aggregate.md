## Bulk Density
The critical value of bulk density for restricting root growth varies with soil type (Hunt and Gilkes,1992) but in general bulk densities greater than 1.6 g cm 3 tend to restrict root growth (McKenzie et al.2004).Sandy soils usually have higher bulk densities.Standard Test Method for density and absorption of coarse aggregate…of aggregate particles and provides an average value representing the sample.Distinction is made between the density of aggregate particles as determined by this test method,and the bulk density of aggregates as determined by Test Method C 29.
