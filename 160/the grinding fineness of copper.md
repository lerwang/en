## Copper ore processing
Copper ore introduction: The copper ore beneficiation production line generally adopts a relatively simple process.After a period of grinding,the fineness 200 mesh accounts for about 50% to 70%,1 rough selection,2~3 selections,1~2 sweeps.If the particle size of the copper mineral is relatively fine,a stage grinding process may be considered.Most of the concentrating plants that deal with.The Recovery of Copper from Smelting Slag by …&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Abstract.Aiming at the recovery of copper from smelting slag,a flotation approach was studied.It was found that this slag composed of fine particles with complex association and distribution,in which bornite was the main copper bearing mineral after a detailed mineralogy analysis via polarizing microscope,SEM and XRD.
