## Direct reduced iron
Direct reduced iron (DRI),also called sponge iron,[1] is produced from the direct reduction of iron ore (in the form of lumps,pellets,or fines) to iron by a reducing gas or elemental carbon produced from natural gas or coal.Many ores are suitable for direct reduction.Direct reduction refers to solid state processes which reduce iron.(PDF) Future Technologies for Energy Efficient Iron and …Future Technologies for Energy Efficient Iron and Steel Making Article (PDF Available) in Annual Review of Energy and the Environment 23(1) &#183; November 1998 with 4,734 Reads.
