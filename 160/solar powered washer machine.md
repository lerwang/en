## Inverter and Battery capacity for washing machine Solar
But my guess the washer.would be out of my budget.At $2 a gal i may just keep using the jenny for 30 mins.At 25 cents a load I'd have to wash a lot of clothes to justify the cost of the inverter.Last edited by Ho jo 12202018,05:10 PM.Off Grid Washing Machine: AmazonThat being said this washer definitely does the trick,it washes well,is surprisingly powerful,and is easy to use and operate.What I didn't like is that the spin cycle makes the washer shake all over the floor.I have to put in one small item at a time to be able to make the machine stay put.
