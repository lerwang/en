## Ore processing Waihi Gold
Ore processing is a 24 hour operation.Ore is stockpiled (1) at the processing plant,and the process begins by feeding the ore into a hopper with a loader.The ore is conveyed,and lime is added (2) to raise the pH of the ore.Gold processing6&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Gold processing Gold processing Mining and concentrating: The nature of the ore deposit determines the mining and mineral processing techniques applied.Oxide ore deposits are frequently of such low grade (e.g.3 to 10 parts per million) that extensive mineral processing cannot economically be justified.In this case they are merely shattered by explosives and then piled into heaps for.

## Advances in the Cyanidation of Gold
Cyanidation,a process used for over a century to extract gold from free milling ores,is so effective that it can economically treat low grade ores (0.5 g t Au).The concentration of cyanide added to dissolve gold is much higher than the stoichiometric requirement because of various interferences.Cyanide free gold recoveryThe infrastructure for a processing plant that uses cyanidation typically costs $30 million,and is therefore,a barrier to entry for gold miners with smaller deposits that do not fit into the large scale economies of gold production.Gold recovery by cyanidation is also of environmental and safety concern as it relies on the use of toxic cyanide.

## Gold cyanidation
29&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Gold cyanidation (also known as the cyanide process or the MacArthur Forrest process) is a hydrometallurgical technique for extracting gold from low grade ore by converting the gold to a water soluble coordination complex.It is the most commonly used leaching process for gold extraction.(PDF) Cyanidation of Refractory Gold Ores: A ReviewCyanidation is the main process in gold leaching.There are several parameters that affect gold recovery and cyanide consumption.In this paper,the effect of the oxidative pretreatment and lead.
