## Processes December 2018
Cobalt oxide silica membranes were prepared and tested to separate small molecular gases,such as He (d k = 2.6 &#197;) and H 2 (d k = 2.89 &#197;),from other gases with larger kinetic diameters,such as CO 2 (d k = 3.47 &#197;) and Ar (d k = 3.41 &#197;).In view of the amorphous nature of silica membranes,pore sizes are generally distributed in the ultra.Low rank and waste coal derived fuel compositions …9&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Coal char,preferably produced by the pyrolytic destructive thermal distillation in the absence of oxygen of carbonaceous materials selected from lignites,peats,low rank coals,and waste coals,is beneficiated,ground and sized and then is admixed in suitable proportions with a liquid organic fraction to form a combustible,liquid solid fuel system which is a nonpolluting,stable.

## Human health and environmental impacts of coal …
During coal combustion both CO 2 and CO gases were mainly emitted as a result of oxidation and they lead to harmful impacts on the environment in the form of global warming and GHG.In addition,these gases are concomitantly correlated with many health issues directly and indirectly including malaria,cardiovascular diseases and asthma.&#187; Natural Gas and the Environment NaturalGas.orgReduced Sludge Coal fired power plants and industrial boilers that use scrubbers to reduce SO2 emissions levels generate thousands of tons of harmful sludge.Combustion of natural gas emits extremely low levels of SO2,eliminating the need for scrubbers,and reducing the amounts of sludge associated with power plants and industrial processes.

## Combustion
17&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Combustion,or burning,is a high temperature exothermic redox chemical reaction between a fuel (the reductant) and an oxidant,usually atmospheric oxygen,that produces oxidized,often gaseous products,in a mixture termed as smoke.Combustion doesn't always result in fire,but when it does,a flame is a characteristic indicator of the reaction.Energy &amp; Fuels Vol 29,No 12Please note: If you switch to a different device,you may be asked to login again with only your ACS ID.
