## Ranking the best calcium supplements of 2020
Citracal uses a blend of calcium carbonate and calcium citrate to provide the mineral source of calcium,and also provides 1000 IU of vitamin D per capsule alongside 80 mg of magnesium,which makes up 20% of your recommended daily intake.Calcium carbonateCalcium carbonate (limestone) is heated to form calcium oxide (quicklime) and carbon dioxide: It is an endothermic reaction and the equilibrium lies far to the left at low temperatures.Only at about 1200 K does the partial pressure of carbon dioxide exceed atmospheric pressure and the decomposition proceeds to completion.
