## Conveyor belt Wikipedia
A conveyor belt is the carrying medium of a belt conveyor system (often shortened to belt conveyor) A belt conveyor system is one of many types of conveyor systems A belt conveyor system consists of two or more pulleys (sometimes referred to as drums),with an endless loop of carrying medium—the conveyor belt—that rotates about themDETERMINATION OF TRAJECTORY OF MATERIAL LEAVING,For design of discharge openings and receiving chutes,it is necessary to know the trajectory of material leaving the head pulley in a conveyor system Trajectory of material is fixed by the angle of separation of material from the belt and the vertical ordinates from the tangent line drawn at,
