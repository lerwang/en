## Optimization of mill performance by using
This test also shows that by feeding the mill with a too dilute pulp,the grinding zones between the media are not saturated,leading to high media wear rate.A variation in total ball angle can be detected and linked to grinding efficiency and charge expansion.This could help the operator to make the right decision and keep the millLargest selection of grinding media Glen Mills,Inc.Alumina Grinding Media (sp.gr.2.8 to 3.9) Available in a range of specific gravities which rises as the alumina (Al2O3) content increases.The grinding media is actually alumina particles held in place by an SiO2 glass phase.Sizes from 400 microns to over 1 inch in.

## Mill Steel Charge Volume Calculation
We can calculate the steel charge volume of a ball or rod mill and express it as the % of the volume within the liners that is filled with grinding media.While the mill is stopped,the charge volume can be gotten by measuring the diameter inside the liners and the distance from the top of the charge to the top of the mill.Jyoti Ceramic Industries Pvt.Ltd.Calculations of media charge: To calculate media charge for batch mill.M = 0.000929 x D2 x L where : M = Grinding media charge in kgs D = Internal Dia of the Mill in cms.after lining L = Internal length of the mill in cms.after lining.To calculate grinding media charge for continuous type ball mill,M = 0.000676 x D2 x L Example To.
