## Grinding and Polishing Guide Buehler
Electrolytic Polishing and Etching Electrolytic polishing or etching is achieved by the completion of an electrical circuit through an electrolyte.The specimen is set as the anode in the circuit.The application of current drives an oxidizing chemical reaction at the anode to achieve dissolution of the metal at the surface of the specimen where it is in contact with the electrolyte.Surface Finishing Tutorial Technical TutorialElectrolytic machining is a method of removing material from metal surfaces by electrolytic etching,and electrolytic grinding is a process that adds mechanical grinding process to this.Typically,with the electrolytic elution processes,some anodic byproducts that inhibit the elution will be formed and in some cases the elution can completely stop due to the metal surface …
