## Ventilation Air Methane (VAM) Utilization Technologies
underground coal mines employ large scale ventilation systems to move fresh air into the mine.These systems dilute methane released into the mine workings as coal is extracted and remove the gas from the mine,thereby maintaining safe working conditions.In mine methane concentrations must be maintained well below the lower explosive limit,soMine & Tunnel Ventilation Products ABC IndustriesMining Ventilation.Underground construction operations depend on thorough planning to meet expectations in execution of every element of a project—and the most extreme mining and tunneling operations demand the most dependable,durable ventilation products available today.
