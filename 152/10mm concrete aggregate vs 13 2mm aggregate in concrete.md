## Density of Coarse Aggregate
The normal weight of stone aggregate in loose state is= 1400 to 1600 kg per cum,but for illustration an average value 1500 kg per cum is considered.Grading of coarse aggregate.Proper graded material should be used for achieving good bond stress.Grading of coarse aggregates are important consideration for getting maximum strength of concrete.What should be the ratio of 20mm to 10mm size …Aggregates make up some 60 % of the concrete mix.• Aggregates are divided into either ‘coarse’ or ‘fine’ categories. Coarse aggregates are particulates that are greater than 4.75mm.The usual range employed is between 9.5mm and 37.5mm in dia.

## Concrete Mix Design Different Grades of Concrete
1 &ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Concrete is a composite mixture which consists of Cement,Sand and Aggregate.Concrete mix design is the procedure for finding the right quantities of these materials to achieve the desired strength.Accurate concrete mix design makes concrete construction economical.Large constructions such as Bridges,dams requires huge amount of concrete.Concrete Aggregates Boral6&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Coarse Aggregate is normally greater than 5mm.Fine Aggregate is aggregate less than 5mm.Can be a single sized material typically 20mm,14mm,10mm,or 7mm or a graded aggregate consisting of a blend of single sized aggregate.Concrete Aggregates are produced to Australian Standards (AS 2758) or to more specific customer requirements.

Depending on the mix design,either can be used to make essentially any range of concrete strengths.When you use a smaller aggregate,such as the 10mm as your nominal coarse aggregate size,the specific surface area of the total volume of coarse aggregate is much higher than for the 20mm aggregate.Convert 3 8 inch to mmHow many inch in 1 mm? The answer is 0.039370078740157.We assume you are converting between inch and millimetre.The SI base unit for length is the metre.Note that rounding errors may occur,so always check the results.Use this page to learn how to convert between inches and millimetres.Type in your own numbers in the form to convert the units!
