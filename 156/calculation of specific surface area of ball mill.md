## Surface Area Calculator
The calculator provided assumes a solid sphere and includes the base of the cap in the calculation of surface area,where the total surface area is the sum of the area of the base and that of the lateral surface of the spherical cap.If using this calculator to compute the surface area of a hollow sphere,subtract the surface area of the base.The energy distribution theory of comminution specific.&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Read &quot;The energy distribution theory of comminution specific surface energy,mill efficiency and distribution mode,Minerals Engineering&quot; on DeepDyve,the largest online rental service for scholarly research with thousands of academic publications available at your fingertips.
