## Refractory ore trouble Russian gold miners
Refractory ore trouble Russian gold miners.Nowhere is this problem of complex ore more prevalent than in Russia,where approximately 80% of gold reserves are refractory or partly so,according to figures from Petropavlovsk PLC.Characterization of refractory behaviour of complex gold.10&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Accurate characterization of an ore is essential to identify the mode and occurrence of gold and gold bearing minerals and hence,to evaluate the refractory behaviour of gold in the traditional cyanidation process.With this information it is then possible to determine the amenability of an ore to different processing options [15−16].

Refractory gold ores are generally defined as those ores that do not give economical recoveries in conventional cyanide circuits where the ore has been ground to around 53 to 75 microns The gold is normally present in refractory gold sulphide ores containing mainly pyrite,arsenopyrite or pyrrhotite and occurs in both the chemically bonded state and as micro or nano size grains of metallic goldGold Ore Processing,Volume 155&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Gold Ore Processing: Project Development and Operations,Second Edition,brings together all the technical aspects relevant to modern gold ore processing,offering a practical perspective that is vital to the successful and responsible development,operation,and closure of any gold ore processing operation.This completely updated edition features coverage of established,newly implemented.

## Gold recovery from refractory gold concentrates by,
refractory gold ores gradually (Karamanev et al,2001; Zhu et al,2012) There are two reasons for refractory of gold: (a) The content of organic carbon in the ores is higher and carbon could be enriched in the flotation processHow Is Gold Extracted From Gold Ore? SciencingGold is usually found alone or alloyed with mercury or silver,but can also be found in ores such as calaverite,sylvanite,nagyagite,petzite and krennerite.Most gold ore now comes from either open pit or underground mines.The ores sometimes contain as little as 5 100 of an ounce of gold …

Gold processing 101.this was a double refractory ore combining sulphide occluded gold with preg robbing carbonaceous material that rendered the ore unsuitable for conventional cyanide leaching and carbon adsorption.(e.g.West Africa) and typically oxidises gold bearing sulphides down to 100m,transforming commonly refractory gold in.Processing of refractory gold oresProcessing of refractory gold ores 1037 The oxidation tanks themselves are often configured in four stages with additional tanks employed in the first stage to accommodate the increased oxidation rates and aeration requirements in the initial phases of the reaction.Residence times in the tanks are often of the order of 3 to 4 days.
