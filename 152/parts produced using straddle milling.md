## Chapter 4.6: Parts Produced on Milling Machines.
2 &ensp;&#0183;&ensp;MILLING MACHINE PROCESSES.The material removal process intended to produce plane,form,or profile surface geometry by a rotating cutter is termed milling.Normally,the rotating spindle and cutter remain stationary,and the workpiece moves in the X,Y,or Z axis.Process operations such as broaching,planing,grinding,and shaping are competitors of milling because these too can produce.Understanding CNC MillingA horizontal CNC milling machine performing a milling operation on a metal part.CNC milling,or computer numerical control milling,is a machining process which employs computerized controls and rotating multi point cutting tools to progressively remove material from the workpiece and produce a custom designed part or product.
