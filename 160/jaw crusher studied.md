## Jaw Crushers
Jaw Crusher technology RETSCH Jaw Crushers are robust and powerful forced feed crushers.The feed material passes through the no rebound hopper and enters the crushing chamber.Size reduction takes place in the wedgeshapedR Crusher Wear Parts Reference Guidecrusher tools E.G.Jaw liners are subject to numerous pressure and impact stresses.Several other factors affect the wear lifetime of crusher wear parts as listed in below Diagram.Wear occurs in all crushers,however wear costs can be controlled by selecting the correct crusher type for the abrasive content of the material to be crushed.

As is the case for jaw crushers,there is not any mutual sliding on grinding surfaces,but simply rolling of the nut on concaves.Comparison between bond crushing energy and fracture energy of rocks in a jaw crusher ‚Ä¶Comparison between bond crushing energy and fracture energy of rocks in a jaw crusher crusher were studied,and the results were discussed with respect to the fracture behaviour modelled by PFC3D software.Then,the determined work done by the jaws of the
