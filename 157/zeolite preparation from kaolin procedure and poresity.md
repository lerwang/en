In this preparation zeolite L is prepared in situ.and 50% hydrous high purity kaolin clay were prepared by spray drying a slurry containing zeolite L crystals,ASP® kaolin clay and sodium silicate solution.The microspheres were subjected to ammonium exchange with a 2M solution of ammonium nitrate until a potassium content of 0.95 K 2 O.Zeolite WikipediaBased on this,he called the material zeolite,from the Greek ζέω (zéō),meaning "to boil.Typical procedures entail heating aqueous solutions of alumina and silica with sodium hydroxide.Equivalent reagents include sodium aluminate and sodium silicate.Further variations include changes in the cations to include quaternary ammonium cations.Synthetic zeolites hold some key advantages.
