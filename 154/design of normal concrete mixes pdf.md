## principles of concrete mix design.ppt
Concrete Mix Design Definition Concrete mix design is defined as the appropriate selection and proportioning of constituents to produce a concrete with pre defined characteristics in the fresh and hardened states.In general,concrete mixes are designed in order toConcrete Mix Design: ProportioningACI 211.1,“Standard Practice for Selecting Proportions for Normal,Heavyweight,and Mass Concrete,” has been adopted by the concrete industry as the standard procedure for mix proportioning.If you design concrete mixtures,it is definitely required reading.
