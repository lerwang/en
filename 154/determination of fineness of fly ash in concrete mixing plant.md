## Chapter 3
Fly ash particles react with free lime in the cement matrix to produce additional cementitious material,and thus,to increase long term strength.Fly Ash Properties Fineness.The fineness of fly ash is important because it affects the rate of pozzolanic activity andPartial Replacement of Cement with Fly Ash and Silica Fume for …2.62 and fineness modulus of 2.86 has been used as fine aggregate for this study.2.3Coarse Aggregate.M30 grade concrete mixes of different Fly ash levels (0% to 60% replacement of cement) and silica fume of 10% with w c ratio of 0.45 were prepared A.
