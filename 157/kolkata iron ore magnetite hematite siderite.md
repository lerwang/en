## Iron Ore
Iron ore mining methods vary by the type of ore being mined.There are four main types of iron ore deposits worked currently,depending on the mineralogy and geology of the ore deposits.These are magnetite,titanomagnetite,massive hematite and pisoliticIron Ore Extraction SideriteThe following is an introduction to these four types of iron ore,magnetite,hematite,limonite and siderite.Iron ore property.Iron is widely distributed in nature (the crust),but since iron is easily combined with other elements to form various iron minerals
