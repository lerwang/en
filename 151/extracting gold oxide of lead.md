## Lead(II) oxide CRT monitor extraction
23&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;I have a large CRT monitor that,by the weight of the monitor,I estimate to contain over two pounds of lead.I want to know if the lead oxide is a mixture with the glass,or if it is chemically bonded to the glass.I also want to know if there is any way (preferably extraction using heat) I can remove the lead in pure form or in oxide form.I know for sure you'd crush the glass.Lead8&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The product contains about 99.5% lead,the remaining 0.5% being mostly antimony and silver with smaller amounts of other metals,including gold.Because it contains silver and gold at this stage,the lead is referred to as bullion lead.The fluxes form a molten slag of …
