## (PDF) Iron Ore Sintering: Process
Sintering is a thermal agglomeration process that is applied to a mixture of iron ore fines,recycled ironmaking products,fluxes,slag forming agents and solid fuel (coke).The.How iron is madeHistorically,iron was produced by the hot blast method,or later,the anthracite furnace.Either way,the fundamental activity in iron making involved a worker stirring small batches of pig iron and cinder until the iron separated from the slag.

## Blast furnace Wikipedia
A blast furnace is a type of metallurgical furnace used for smelting to produce industrial metals,generally pig iron,but also others such as lead or copper Blast refers to the combustion air being "forced" or supplied above atmospheric pressure In a blast furnace fuel (),ores,and flux (limestone) are continuously supplied through the top of,
