## Kaolinite Processing Equipment,Process Flow,Cases
Kaolin froth flotation process The purpose of the flotation operation is to float titanium impurities from the kaolin.Since the impurity particles are extremely fine,a carrier flotation process is usually employed.The carrier mineral may be calcite or silica sand (.Kaolin Processing Plant&amp;Machinery&amp;Equipment Supplier …Thus,kaolin can be concentrated.Flotation: Selective flocculation flotation process is comparatively simple flotation process.First solid particles in suspension liquid should be fully dispersed,then flocculant will be added to adsorb target mineral selectively.
