## Iron ore
Increasing iron ore demand,coupled with the depletion of high grade hematite ores in the United States,after World War II led to development of lower grade iron ore sources,principally the utilization of magnetite and taconite.Iron ore mining methods vary by theIron in the Industrial RevolutionAs the industrial revolution developed,so did the iron industry.A set of innovations,from different materials to new techniques,allowed iron production to expand greatly.In 1709,Darby became the first man to smelt iron with coke (which is made from heating coal).
