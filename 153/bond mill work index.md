## Mill (grinding)
A mill is a device that breaks solid materials into smaller pieces by grinding,crushing,or cutting.Such comminution is an important unit operation in many processes.There are many different types of mills and many types of materials processed in them.Historically mills were powered by hand (e.g.via a hand crank),working animal (e.g.Procedure for Determination of Ball Bond Work Index in the.Procedure for determination of ball Bond work index in the commercial operations R.Ahmadi *,Sh.Shahsavari Iran Mineral Processing Research Center (IMPRC),Karaj,Tehran,Islamic Republic of Iran a r t i c l e i n f o a b s t r a c t The Bond ball mill grindability test is run in a laboratory until a circulating load of 250% is developed.It provides the Bond Ball Mill Work Index which.
