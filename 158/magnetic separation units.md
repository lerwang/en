## LIMS dry drum
LIMS dry drum Metso's LIMS dry drum low intensity magnetic separators consist of a stationary magnetic yoke with a number of permanent magnets placed inside a rotating drum of non magnetic material.The separators are available with dust housing designs andEddy current separators for recovering non ferrous metals …The impact of the magnetic field often starts too early in concentric pole systems,i.e.the non ferrous particles depart too soon from the magnetic field and are therefore inadequately diverted.On the other hand,the eccentric pole system ensures that the magnetic field's influence is only at its highest in the moment of separation and a field is not generated at other points in the belt drum.

## Magnetic field
A magnetic field is a vector field that describes the magnetic influence of electric charges in relative motion[1][2] and magnetized materials.A charge that is moving parallel to a current of other charges experiences a force perpendicular to its own velocity.[3] The effects of magnetic fields are commonly seen in permanent magnets,which.Magnetic separator &amp; magnetic filtering Goudsmit …We make use of three types of magnetic separators,each with its own specific characteristics and applications: Magnet separators with plate or block magnets (suspension magnets) have a deeply penetrating magnetic field for capturing ferromagnetic metal particles as small as 1 mm.Plate magnets,chute magnets and external pole magnets are used in pipeline transport (inline magnetic separators).
