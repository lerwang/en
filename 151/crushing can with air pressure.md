## Air Pressure Crushing Cans
Science Fair Project: Air Pressure Crushing Cans.A can’s interior is filled with water and air particles.By heating it,the water inside the can will change its state from being a liquid to a gas,becoming water vapor.The water vapor will push the air that was originally inside the can out into the atmosphere.Can the Ocean's Pressure Crush You? SciencingCan the Ocean's Pressure Crush You?.Your lungs are pushed on by the pressure of the air,the same as the gallon drum.In the air,your lungs have the same internal pressure as the outside atmosphere,so your rib cage doesn't collapse.Thirty three feet under the ocean,the external pressure is twice the internal pressure,and your only.

## Why Don't We Get Crushed By Atmospheric Pressure.
8&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;This essentially implies that there is a certain equalization of pressures involved in this case,which is why there is no pressure difference and why we don’t feel ‘burdened down by air’.The pressure of air that is present outside your body is the same as that of the air present ‘inside’ your body.The air that is constantly present.Can Crushing7&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Can Crushing.Procedure.This demonstrates phase change and the effect of unbalanced pressure.When the water in the can is heated,it changes to steam.This steam fills the can,replacing most of the air that was inside of it.When the inverted can is placed in cold water,the steam condenses,leaving the can mostly empty,and thus with a.

## The Mechanics of Air Pressure
Air pressure is a difficult concept.How can something invisible have mass and weight? Air has mass because it is made up of a mixture of gases that have mass.Add up the weight of all these gases that compose dry air (oxygen,nitrogen,carbon dioxide,hydrogen,and others) and you get the weight of dry air.Air Pressure Experiments: I Can't Take the Pressure.Students gain an understanding of air pressure by using candy or cookie wafers to model how it changes with altitude,comparing its magnitude to gravitational force per unit area,and observing its magnitude with an aluminum can crushing experiment.Worksheets provided.
