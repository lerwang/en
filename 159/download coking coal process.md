## EXPERT CONTROL SYSTEM FOR COAL BLENDING.
Abstract: Based on the statistical data and experience knowledge of the coal blending and coking process,a mathematical model and rule model which forecast the quality of coke and compute blending ratio of coal (BRC) were presented.An algorithm to compute.Metallurgical coal8&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Metallurgical coal or coking coal[1] is a grade of coal that can be used to produce good quality coke.Coke is an essential fuel and reactant in the blast furnace process for primary steelmaking.[2][3][4] The demand for metallurgical coal is highly coupled to the demand for steel.Primary steelmaking companies often have a division that.
