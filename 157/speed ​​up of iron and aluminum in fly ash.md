## Fly Ash
Fly ash is perhaps the best known type of coal ash.It is a powdery material made up of tiny,separate glass spheres.Chemically,fly ash consists primarily of silicon,aluminum,iron and calcium oxides.The most common application for AEP fly ash is as partial.Elemental Analysis of Trace Elements in Fly AshFly ash is small,dark flecks of ash produced by burning coal; it is composed of particulates that are driven out of coal fired boilers into the air with flue gases.As global energy needs to increase to keep up with our ever changing technology,the demand is met by burning fossil fuels in power plants.
