## Application of Clinker and Iran Cement
The clinker is exported by some builders so that they can mix an adequate quantity of active ingredients for the desired consistency and texture.Clinker is obtained as red hot molten texture from the lower end of the kiln during cement manufacturing.Harmful Effects of Iron Oxides HealthfullyRespitory Damage In Australia,storms whipping red iron oxide dust into the atmosphere of city centers has revealed that iron oxide can cause breathing problems and exacerbate asthma,allergies and sinus infections.The iron oxide itself isn't so dangerous as the.

## Manufacture Of Cement
Clinker is then cooled and ground in tube mills (Fig.24),where 3% of gypsum is added.Generally,cement is stored in bags of 50 kg.A flow diagram of dry process is shown in Fig.25.The purpose of adding gypsum is to coat the cement particles by interferingMorphological Analysis of White Cement Clinker Minerals: …The paper deals with a formation of artificial rock (clinker).Temperature plays the capital role in the manufacturing process.So,it is useful to analyze a poor clinker to identify the different phases and defects associated with their crystallization.X ray fluorescence.

Iron is only in some cements used for certain things.Putting iron in the cement makes it stronger,which is why it is only needed for things that need extra strength,such as steam.Review Article PARENTERAL SUSPENSION: AN OVERVIEWbetween two particles exceeds attractive London force,resulting in deflocculated particles.• Deflocculated particles settle at slow rate and they form a hard cake on settling which cannot be easily redispersed.• Flocculating agents are added to reduce the

## Portland cement clinker
Portland cement clinker is a dark grey nodular material made by heating ground limestone and clay at a temperature of about 1400 C 1500 C.The nodules are ground up to a fine powder to produce cement,with a small amount of gypsum added to control the setting properties.PowderA powder is a dry,bulk solid composed of many very fine particles that may flow freely when shaken or tilted.Powders are a special sub class of granular materials,although the terms powder and granular are sometimes used to distinguish separate classes of material.In particular,powders refer to those granular materials that have the finer.
