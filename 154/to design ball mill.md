## Ball Mill
The ball mill is a tumbling mill that uses steel balls as the grinding media.The length of the cylindrical shell is usually 1 1.5 times the shell diameter (Figure 8.11).The feed can be dry,with less than 3% moisture to minimize ball coating,or slurry containing 20The Selection and Design of Mill LinersFigure 5.High low wave ball mill liner Materials The selection of the material of construction is a function of the application,abrasivity of ore,size of mill,corrosion environment,size of balls,mill speed,etc.liner design and material of constru
