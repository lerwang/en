## Manganese oxide minerals: Crystal structures and …
Manganese oxide minerals have been used for thousands of years—by the ancients for pigments and to clarify glass,and today as ores of Mn metal,catalysts,and battery material.More than 30 Mn oxide minerals occur in a wide variety of geological settings.They are major components of Mn nodules that pave huge areas of the ocean floor and bottoms of many fresh water lakes.Manganese2 &ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Manganese is a cofactor for several enzymes involved in bone formation.In animals,manganese deficiency can impair bone formation and reduce bone mineral density,and manganese supplementation can increase both bone mineral density and bone formation.
