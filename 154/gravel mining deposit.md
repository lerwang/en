Quantitative yield analysis of a sand &amp; gravel deposit is based on the idea that when making your product or products,you will “run out” of one grain size or fraction first.This fraction will limit howSand and Gravel Exploration,Extraction and Reclamation on …Sand and Gravel Surface Lease • SHT or RMs who locate a large quantity sand and gravel deposit on Crown resource land as a result of their own exploration activity (as authorized by SE) and where the aggregate is intended to be used for public development
