## Copper Mining and Processing: Processing of Copper …
Copper processing is a complicated process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper called cathodes,which will ultimately be made into products for everyday use.The most common types of ore,copper oxide and copper sulfide,undergo two different processes,hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy,respectively,due to the different.Energy and Environmental Profile of the U.S.Mining …8&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Energy and Environmental Profile of the U.S.Mining Industry 5.1 Process Overview 5.1.1 Copper Ore Mining Copper is commonly extracted from surface,underground and increasingly,from in situ operations.In 2000,the principal mining States,in descending order,Arizona,Utah,New Mexico,and Montana,accounted for 99 percent of domestic.

## How copper is made
The process of extracting copper from copper ore varies according to the type of ore and the desired purity of the final product.Each process consists of several steps in which unwanted materials are physically or chemically removed,and the concentration of copper is progressively increased.Copper Mining and Processing2&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Because copper is an element,it can be infinitely recycled.New and old copper scrap or copper alloys can be melted,re purified,and recycled into new components ~50% of copper used in the copper industry was recycled.In 2010,770,000 metric tons of copper …
