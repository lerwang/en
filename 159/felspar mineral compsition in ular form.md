## Feldspar Chemical composition Britannica.com
Feldspar Chemical composition: All the rock forming feldspars are aluminosilicate minerals with the general formula AT4O8 in which A = potassium,sodium,or calcium (Ca); and T = silicon (Si) and aluminum (Al),with a Si:Al ratio ranging from 3:1 to 1:1.Microcline and orthoclase are potassium feldspars (KAlSi3O8),usually designated Or in discussions involving their end member composition.What is Sand Overview and GeologyComposition of sand.Sand is a.sand grains which are composed of a single mineral — quartz grains,feldspar.immature and it also tends to form when rocks.
