## US5308586A Electrostatic separator using a bead bed,
Beads for use in beds in electrostatic separators for the separation of suspended particles from hydrocarbon oils Electrostatic separators employing a bed of these beads have the capacity to remove as much as 99 weight percent of contaminating particles,such as catalyst fines,from various oil fractions to levels of less than 100 parts per million and even less than 5 ppmELECTROSTATIC SEPARATION ThermopediaElectrostatic separation is done by initially charging the particulates or contaminants and then moving and concentrating them at the electric field boundary Electrical separation was first demonstrated by Hohlfield in 1824 by clearing a smoked filled jar with an electrified point
