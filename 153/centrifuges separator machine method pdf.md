## Centrifuge
A centrifuge is a piece of equipment that puts an object in rotation around a fixed axis (spins it in a circle),applying a force perpendicular to the axis of spin (outward) that can be very strong.The centrifuge works using the sedimentation principle,where the centrifugal acceleration causes denser substances and particles to move outward in the radial direction.THE CHOICE OF BELT PRESS vs CENTRIFUGEThe choice of Belt Press vs Centrifuge for sludge dewatering,is often a difficult problem for specifiers,The Centrifuge is a high speed rotating machine,suitable for large plants with well screened sludges,where initial and operating cost,and high power requirements are

Principles of Centrifugation You may have operated a centrifuge before.Or perhaps this is your first day on a new job at a new lab or Life Science facility.Whatever the case may be,you may have some questions about centrifuges and their operating principles.We.(PDF) Centrifugation TechniquesCentrifugation is the use of the centrifugal forces generated in a spinning rotor to separate biological particles,such as cells,viruses,sub cellular organelles,macromolecules.

## Engineering Considerations for Gas Centrifuges,
For example,the United States developed prototype supercritical centrifuges but chose gaseous diffusion as the industrial method for uranium enrichment for its World War II Manhattan Project Historically,the least time required to develop indigenous centrifuge technology has been 8 years,in the case of the Soviet Union(PDF) The use of disc stack centrifuge in the virgin olive,Jul 09,2018&#0183;&#32;The disc stack centrifuge (DSC) in the virgin olive oil (VOO) industry is widely used for oil purification at a final stage of extraction process The obtained oil should be commercialized.
