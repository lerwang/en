## Mass,Weight,Density or Specific Gravity of Bulk Materials
As specific gravity is just a comparison,it can be applied across any units The density of pure water is also 624 lbs cuft (pounds per cubic foot) and if we know that ammonium nitrate has a sg of 073 then we can calculate that its density is 073 x 624 = 45552 lbs cuft Note,kg cum divided by 1602 = lbs cuftBulk Density and Void Percentage Test for Aggregates The,Bulk density (M)= (G T) F Equation 4 where: M: bulk density of the aggregate,kg m^3,G: mass of the aggregate plus the measure,kg,T: mass of the measure,kg,V: volume of the measure,m^3,F: factor for measure,m^3,computed from equation 2 The bulk density determined by this test method is for aggregate in an oven dry condition
