## HYDRATION OF CEMENT
21&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;HYDRATION OF CEMENT It is the reaction (s eries of chemical reactions) of cement with water to form the binding material.In other words,in the presence of water,the silicates (C3S and C2S) and aluminates (C3A and C4AF) form products of hydration which in time produce a firm and hard mass the hydrated cement paste.ICR Optimization in the use of cement additives29&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Dehydration of natural gypsum and the consequent formation of hemihydrate and anhydrous CaSO4 exerts a significant effect on the cement’s particle size distribution.This effect may be summarized in the following key points: • Increasing the amount of natural gypsum determines an almost linear increase of the cement’s Blaine specific surface.
