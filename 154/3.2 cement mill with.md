## Cement Production
In terms of reactions which form cement clinker the four oxides which are required for the clinker,SiO 2,Al 2 O 3,Fe 2 O 3 and CaO need to be liberated from their raw material state and allowed to combine in the forms required.Most of the CaO is provided to 3RawmillA raw mill is the equipment used to grind raw materials into &quot;rawmix&quot; during the manufacture of cement.Rawmix is then fed to a cement kiln,which transforms it into clinker,which is then ground to make cement in the cement mill.The raw milling stage of the process effectively defines the chemistry (and therefore physical properties) of the finished cement,and has a larg
