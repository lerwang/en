## Mining Countries of Africa
Mining fact:Despite massive mineral wealth,the Nigerian mining industry is vastly underdeveloped and only accounts for 0.3% of the country’s GDP and this due to oil resources.The underdevelopment is resulting in Nigeria having to import processed minerals,even though it could be locally produced.Reading: Mining and Mineral Use GeologyReading: Mining and Mineral Use.Some minerals are very useful.An ore is a rock that contains minerals with useful elements.Aluminum in bauxite ore (figure 1) is extracted from the ground and refined to be used in aluminum foil and many other products.The cost of creating a product from a mineral depends on how abundant the mineral is.
