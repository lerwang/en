## TECHNOLOGY FOR PROCESSING OF REFRACTORY GOLD …
Albion technology makes it possible to process refractory products with quite small capital investments.It enables involving medium and small refractory gold deposits into processing.KEYWORDS Gold,atmospheric oxidation,refractory concentrate,leachingGold extractionGold extraction refers to the processes required to extract gold from its ores.This may require a combination of comminution,mineral processing,hydrometallurgical,and pyrometallurgical processes to be performed on the ore.[1] Gold mining from alluvium ores was once achieved by techniques associated with placer mining such as simple gold.
