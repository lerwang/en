In this paper,the work consists of categorizing telecommunication base stations (BTS) for the Sahel area of Cameroon according to their power consumption per month.It consists also of proposing a model of a power consumption and finally proceeding to energy audits in each type of base station in order to outline the possibilities of realizing energy savings.Coal PowerProducing electricity from coal starts when the coal is pulverised in huge mills into a fine powder before it is blown into huge kettles,called boilers.Due to the heat in the boiler,the coal particles combust and burn to generate heat to turn water into steam.The steam from the boilers is used to turn the blades of a giant fan or propeller.
