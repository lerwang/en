## Manganese Oxide
Lithium Manganese Oxide,known as LiMn 2 O 4 or LMO,differs from LFP and LCO in that its crystal form is that of a lattice type spinel structure.The manganese atoms are in a three dimensional octahedral site formation with the manganese taking up one fourth of the location in the lithium layer leaving one quarter of the manganese sites vacant.Manganese OxideLithium manganese oxide LiMn 2 O 4 or Li 1+x Mn 2−x O 4 (x ≤ 0.8) forms a spatial network,in which manganese exhibits the thermodynamic valence of +3.5,because Mn(III) and Mn(IV) coexist.During charging (delithiation),more Mn(IV) is formed.
