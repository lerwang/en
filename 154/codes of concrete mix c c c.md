Batching is the process of measuring concrete mix ingre dients by either mass or volume and introducing them into the mixer.To produce concrete of uniform quality,the ingredients must be measured accurately for each batch.Most specifications require that batching be done by mass rather than by volume (ASTM C 94 or AASHTO M 157).Water and liquid admixtures can be measured …NRMCA Codes and StandardsCodes and Standards Overview.Building codes and standards affect much of the ready mixed concrete construction in the United States.The purpose of any building code is to provide a safe building for all occupants,owners and emergency responders.
