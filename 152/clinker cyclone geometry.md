## geometry of cyclone in cement process
Numerical study of gas solid flow in a cyclone separator.Some factors which affect the performance of cyclone were identified.on the inner conical surface in such cyclones used in the cement industry.one gas inlet,the axis of the vortex does not coincide with the axis of the geometry of cyclone.may also be stagnant on the wall of cyclone during the process of collection.ClinkerizationAlkalies A part of alkalies Na 2 O and K 2 O combines chemically with clinker minerals,while as the major part remains as water soluble and affects adversely cement strength (28 Day Strength).If alkalies are not balanced by sulphates,volatile recirculation phenomenon starts disturbing kiln operation due to kiln inlet,bottom cyclone coating.
