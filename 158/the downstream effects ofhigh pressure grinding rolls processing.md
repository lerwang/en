At current gold prices this is worth about $400.Both smelter treatment charges and oxidation or bio leach costs are around $200 t of concentrate so a minimum GSR for effective downstream processing is 0.5,but clearly this is a function of gold price.High Pressure Grinding RollsHPGR or high pressure grinding rolls have made broad advances into nonferrous metal mining.The technology is now widely viewed as a primary milling alternative,and there arc a number of large installations commissioned in recent years.After these.
