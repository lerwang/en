## Extractive metallurgy
Extractive metallurgical technologies are divided into mineral processing,hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy areas.Extractive metallurgical and mineral dressing operations are divided into: Ferrous metallurgy,which includes reduction of iron ore into iron,and further refinement and alloying with other metals to make steel.Mineral processing24&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Dewatering is an important process in mineral processing.The purpose of dewatering is to remove water absorbed by the particles which increases the pulp density.This is done for a number of reasons,specifically,to enable ore handling and concentrates to be transported easily,allow further processing to occur and to dispose of the gangue.

## Ore
The ore grade,or concentration of an ore mineral or metal,as well as its form of occurrence,will directly affect the costs associated with mining the ore.The cost of extraction must thus be weighed against the metal value contained in the rock to determine what ore can be processed and what ore is of too low a grade to be worth mining.Mineral Processing and Extractive Metallurgy Newsletter5&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Mineral processing and geomechanics research projects are carried out in dedicated laboratories,while a host of analytical services are available on site.To support the mining and mineral engineering research,further knowledge of ore deposit formation and efficient mineral exploration is investigated.CSM’s

## Metallurgy Department
The Metallurgy Department was initially a section under the Mining Department of the former Zambia Institute of Technology (ZIT) which was founded in 1970,running both Advanced Certificate and Diploma programmes until 1989,when the Advanced Certificate programs were phased out to pave way for the introduction of degree programmes,namely the Bachelor of Engineering in Metallurgical.Extractive metallurgy and mineral processing types …Extractive metallurgy usually refers to all operations carried out to extract a metal from an ore,concentrate,or composite materials.Sometimes,the term extractive metallurgy refers to both the development of metals from a raw or an enriched ore and also the manufacture and processing of alloys to produce a material with specific properties.

The extractive metallurgy of tin is complicated by tin’s affinity for iron,and by the need to achieve good metallurgical recovery because of tin’s high unit value.Tin has a low melting point of 232 &#176;C,but the smelting temperatures needed are quite high.Figure 1 shows the range of tin processing options.MetallurgyMetallurgy Metallurgy Extractive metallurgy: Following separation and concentration by mineral processing,metallic minerals are subjected to extractive metallurgy,in which their metallic elements are extracted from chemical compound form and refined of impurities.Metallic compounds are frequently rather complex mixtures (those treated commercially are for the most part sulfides,oxides.
