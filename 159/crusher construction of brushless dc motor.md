## What are Brushless DC Motors Renesas Electronics
A motor converts supplied electrical energy into mechanical energy.Various types of motors are in common use.Among these,brushless DC motors (BLDC) feature high efficiency and excellent controllability,and are widely used in many applications.What is a Brushless DC Motor Construction?The brushless DC (BLDC) motor is a type of the synchronous electric motor.In other words,the rotating speed of the electric motor's rotor is subject to the impact of the speed of the stator's rotating magnetic field and the number of the stator's poles (p),namely n=60.f p.

## Brushless DC Motors (BLDC): What Are They &amp; How Do They Work?
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;What is a Brushless Motor? A brushless DC motor (also known as a BLDC motor or BL motor) is an electronically commuted DC motor which does not have brushes.The controller provides pulses of current to the motor windings which control the speed and torque of the synchronous motor.These types of motBrushless DC Motor vs.AC Motor vs.Brushed MotorMotor Construction.Brushed DC motors depend on a mechanical system to transfer current,while AC and brushless DC gear motors use an electronic mechanism to control current.The brushed motors have a wound armature attached to the center with a permanent magnet bonded to a steel ring surrounding the rotor.
