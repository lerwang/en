## THE GRINDING CHARGE OF ROTARY MILLS
THE GRINDING CHARGE OF ROTARY MILLS Prof.Dr.Eng.Gh.Ene “Politehnica” University of Bucharest ABSTRACT This paper presents the achievemens of grinding charge for the tube mills with balls.The author shows charactheristic size of grinding media charge: bulk density,porosBall millA ball mill,a type of grinder,is a cylindrical device used in grinding (or mixing) materials like ores,chemicals,ceramic raw materials and paints.Ball mills rotate around a horizontal axis,partially filled with the material to be ground plus the grinding medium.Different materials are used as media,including ceramic balls,flint pebbles and stainless steel balls.

## Ball mill
A ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind,blend and sometimes for mixing of materials for use in mineral dressing processes,paints,pyrotechnics,ceramics and selective laser sintering.It works on the principle of impact and attrition: size reduction is done by impact as the balls drop from near the top of the shell.A ball mill.2000 Ton Capacity Grinding Mill Media Charge Calculationbead mill grinding media calculation.Calculations of media charge: To calculate media charge for batch mill.M = 0.000929 x D2 x L where : M = Grinding media charge in kgs D = Internal Dia of the Mill in cms.after lining L = Internal length of the mill in cms.after lining.

## Ball Mills
Ball Mills are generally used to grind material 1 4 inch and finer,down to the particle size of 20 to 75 microns.To achieve a reasonable efficiency with ball mills,they must be operated in a closed system,with oversize material continuously being recirculated back into the mill to be reduced.feldspar grinding ball mill calculation pdf in senegalBall Mill Grinding Media Charging Calculation.Ball Mill Grinding Media Charging Calculation Technical notes 8 grinding r p king 82 roolvlrq mp is the mass of any particle media or charge in the mill and dm is the diameter of the mill inside the line

## Mill Steel Charge Volume Calculation
We can calculate the steel charge volume of a ball or rod mill and express it as the % of the volume within the liners that is filled with grinding media.While the mill is stopped,the charge volume can be gotten by measuring the diameter inside the liners and the distance from the top of the charge to the top of the mill.ball mill internal calculationsD = Internal Dia of the Mill in cms.after lining L = Internal length of the mill in cms.after lining.To calculate grinding media charge for continuous type ball mill,M = 0.000676 x D2 x L Example To calculate grinding media charge for a 180 cm dia x 180 cm long batch type ball mill with Duralox 50 mm thick bricks.Formula to be used is.
