## Analysis of CO2 Emission for the Cement …
The cement industry is a significant CO 2 emitter mainly due to the calcinations of raw materials and the combustions of fuels.Some measures have been considered to reduce the CO 2 emissions in cement industry,of which alternative raw materials are the most efficient practicing way.In this study,a LCA based CO 2 accounting framework with alternative raw materials was constructed to analyze.Fly Ash as a Portland Cement Raw Material25&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;In 1966,approximately 125 million tons of raw materials,exclusive of fuel,air,water,and power were consumed to produce almost 74 million tons of portland cement in the United States that is about 3,400 pounds of raw material per ton of finished cement produced.To present the figure in another way,a single plant producing 600,000 tons of cement a year would consume about 1,000,000 tons.

## How Cement Is Made
The finely ground raw material or the slurry is fed into the higher end.At the lower end is a roaring blast of flame,produced by precisely controlled burning of powdered coal,oil,alternative fuels,or gas under forced draft.As the material moves through the kiln,certain elements are driven off in the form of gases.Raw Materials Used For Manufacturing of CementThis makes the cement sound if present in small quantity but an excess can make the cement unsound.Cement is sometimes blended with other cementitious and or a special material.This cement is called blended cement.They are produced by properly blending two or more types of cementitious materials and cement raw materials.
