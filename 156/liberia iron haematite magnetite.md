## Iron Ore Haematite And Magnetite
Iron ore is used to make iron and steel eg haematite and magnetite.Iron is produced (extracted) in a blast furnace by reducing iron oxides with carbon and it is the carbon that removes the oxygen from the iron oxides the carbon is known as the reducing agent.Chat With Sales;West and Central African iron ore development and its.Africa's total iron ore reserves (measured plus inferred) contain an estimated 34.9bt of haematite and 17.3bt of magnetite (see Appendix 1).In comparative terms,Africa has similar reserves to Australia,with 37.0bt of reported haematite reserves and 10.4bt of magnetite,although reserve levels provide a limited insight into production potential.
