## Smelting
Smelting is an energy intensive process used to refine an ore into usable metal.Most ore deposits contain metals in the reacted or combined form.Magnetite (Fe 3 O 4 ),hematite (Fe 2 O 3 ),goethite (αFeO[OH]),limonite (the generic formula for limonite is FeO[OH].nH 2 O),and siderite (FeCO 3 ) are iron ores,and Cu 5 FeSO 4 is a copper ore.SmeltingOxidation smelting is a process based upon an oxidation reaction,such as copper sulfide,matte smelting of nickel mineral raw.(impure metals) for further processing (refining).The pyrometallurgical process is suitable for iron ore,chromite,lead,zinc,copper.
