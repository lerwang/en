Free silica quartz should have no adverse effect below a particle size of about 32um.During reaction in the kiln,large quartz grains react at their surface with nearby CaO grains to form C2S.The reaction in the absence of liquid phase occurs by solid solid reaction with CaO particles,so the smaller the particle sizes of both silica and calcite in the kiln feed,the quicker the reaction.Silica vs ClayVerb () To add clay to,to spread clay onto.(of sugar) To purify using clay.* 1776,Book IV,Chapter 7: Of Colonies,Part 2: Causes of Prosperity of New Colonies,They amounted,therefore,to a prohibition,at first of claying' or refining sugar for any foreign market,and at present of ' claying or refining it for the market,which takes off,perhaps,more than nine tenths of the whole.
