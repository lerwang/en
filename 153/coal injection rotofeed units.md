## How to switch a power station off coal
Drax began cofiring across all six units in 2003,using two different materials a mix of around 5% biomass and 95% coal.A direct injection facility was added in 2005.It involved blowing crushed wood pellets into coal fuel lines from two of the power station’s.Replacing Coal used in Steelmaking with Biocarbon from …The first option is to use biocarbon as a component of the pulverized coal injection (PCI),which takes place through tuyeres in the lower part of the blast furnace.In this research,two kinds of side streams from the forest industry were tested and evaluated as raw
