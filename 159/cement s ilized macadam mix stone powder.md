## Effect of fines on the mechanical properties of …
It is necessary to reduce the use of crushed stone and cement in base courses because of environmental concerns and cost issues.The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of fines on the mechanical properties of composite soil stabilizer stabilized gravel soil (CSSSGS) compared with cement stabilized gravel soil (CSGS) in laboratory performance tests.Freeze thaw durability of cement stabilized macadam.This is because the pores between the soil particles are filled with cement powder.The hydration of cement powder provides effective cementation force for graded macadam,which significantly improves the flexural strength (Zeng et al.2013 and Farhan et al.2015).Hence,the cement content effectively improves the freeze thaw durability of.
