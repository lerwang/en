Siltation of reservoirs can also have a number of other impacts,including increased evaporation losses,increased backwater flooding and also could damage the power house turbines.Way back in a New Delhi symposium in 1995,Gregory Morris,author of the Reservoir Sedimentation Handbook,warned of mistaken comparisons between dams and infrastructure such as roads.Black Warrior Riverkeeper Siltation & SedimentationSedimentation,or siltation,is one of the most severe threats to the Black Warrior River The primary sources of this muddy water are irresponsible development projects,reckless logging and mining operations,and poorly built and maintained roads
