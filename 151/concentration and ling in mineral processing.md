## Mineral processing
Mineral processing Mineral processing Concentration: Concentration involves the separation of valuable minerals from the other raw materials received from the grinding mill.In large scale operations this is accomplished by taking advantage of the different properties of the minerals to be separated.These properties can be colour (optical sorting),density (gravity separation),magnetic.Monazite12&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Other major monazite sources are heavy mineral sands from so called placerdeposits which are usually mined by dredging or scraping,followed by screening and concentration in spiral concentrators.Mineral concentrates are then washed,dried and fed into magnetic separators to remove e.g.ilmenite and other magnetic minerals.

## Mineral Processing Technology
Revising someone else's text is not an easy thing to do successfully,and there was a real danger of throwing the baby out with the bath water.The value of Mineral Processing Technology lies in its clear exposition of the principles and practice of mineral processing,with examples taken from practice.International Journal of Mineral Processing8&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The International Journal of Mineral Processing covers aspects of the processing of mineral resources such as: Metallic and non metallic ores,coals,and secondary resources.Topics dealt with include: Geometallurgy,comminution,sizing,classification (in air and water),gravity concentration,flotation,electric and magnetic separation.

## What is a mineral processing plant?
A plant for ore processing is a series of equipment and devices connected in a constructed way that allow the ore pass through several units,until it get to the concentrate storage.The previous description is general,as some portable simple units of grizzly and a crusher are considered as mineral processing plants.But usually,an ore plant is complicated.EFFECTIVE PROCESSING OF LOW GRADE IRON ORE …15&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;concentration process is one of the oldest and most economic techniques (Brut,1999).Although in the twentieth century gravity concentration has been partially replaced by other techniques,notably,flotation and magnetic separation,they have not made it obsolete.Gravity separation techniques are widely used in mineral beneficiation
