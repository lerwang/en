## Aluminium bronze
Aluminium bronze is a type of bronze in which aluminium is the main alloying metal added to copper,in contrast to standard bronze (copper and tin) or brass (copper and zinc).A variety of aluminium bronzes of differing compositions have found industrial use,with most ranging from 5% to 11% aluminium by weight,the remaining mass being copper.Aluminum and Copper wiring? Yahoo Answers&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;My new home has a mix of copper and aluminum wiring.My mother used a shop vac in one of the recepticles last week and blew two of them in my bedroom.Then this weekend my brother was replacing my exhaust fan in the bathroom and that proceeded to blow.

## Copper or aluminium? Which one to use and when?
Both Aluminium and Copper will oxidize when exposed to the atmosphere.Oxides,chlorides,or sulfides of the base metal are much more conductive for copper than aluminum.For a low resistance aluminum joint,the aluminum bar conductors must be plated toAluminum vs.Copper liquid cooling partsAs you can see copper and nickel (marked with red) are quite close to each other,while aluminum (also marked with red) is a bit far away from them on the chart.Mixing copper and nickel in a liquid cooling loop with aluminum parts will induce galvanic corrosion
