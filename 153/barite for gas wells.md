Answer (1 of 5): Barite is used as a weight material in the drilling fluid (drilling mud) used while drilling a well Initially,water is used as the drilling fluid,then bentonite (Jel) is used to form a wall cake on the newly drilled well After the surface pipe is set,mud weight is increased.Barite: World USGSgas wells These muds lubricate the drill and the stem,seal off the walls of the hole,remove cuttings,and help to confine the high oil and gas pressures met at depth Barite is particularly well suited to this purpose because it is soft (about 3 on Moh's scale of hard&#173; ness),heavy (max sp gr 45),and rather inert In 1967,about 80
