## Finite element analysis for grinding and lapping of wire,
Wafer grinding can be used for grinding wire sawn wafers 60 to replace or partially replace lapping [16] Fig 2 illustrates 61 the wafer grinding process [17] Its advantages over lapping 62 include the following: (1) the process is fully automatic with 63 cassette to cassette operation,(2) it,MECHANICAL CHARACTERIZATION IN FAILURE STRENGTH OF …surface flaws induced in the wafer backside during coarse grinding.It was found that the use of finer grits would generate silicon dice with a better strength [ 8].Wafer sawing (or dicing) is carried out for thesingulation of dice after the thinning process.Diamond
