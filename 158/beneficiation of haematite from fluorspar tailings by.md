## Optimization of Reverse Cationic Flotation of Low Grade …
Due to gradual depletion of high grade iron ores,there is a need to investigate the treatment of low grade iron ores.Current procedures are time and cost intensive.Batch laboratory scale reverse cationic flotation was employed to concentrate low grade Fe ore,found in fluorspar tails in the form of hematite.This study used two types of depressants (soluble starch and dextrin) and two types.Physical,Chemical and Mineralogical Characterization of …The beneficiation potential of fluorspar tailings to produce high grade haematite pellets was investigated.Detailed characterisation of the tailings was carried out,where physical,chemical,and mineralogical and liberation properties of the sample were determined.
