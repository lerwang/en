## Difference Between Sodium Carbonate &amp; Calcium …
The carbonate ion (CO 3) has a valency of and forms compounds with sodium (Na),which has a valency of +1,and calcium (Ca),which has a valency of +2.The resulting compounds are sodium carbonate (Na 2 CO 3) and calcium carbonate (CaCO 3).The former is known as soda ash or washing soda,and the latter,known as calcite,is a primary component of chalk,limestone and marble.How baking soda is made material,manufacture,making,The sodium sulfate was then heated with coal and limestone to form sodium carbonate,or soda ash,Although this method of producing baking soda ash is widely used,it is also problematic because the chemicals used in the process are pollutants and cause disposal problems An alternative is to refine soda ash from trona ore,a natural deposit
