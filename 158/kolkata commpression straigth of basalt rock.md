## Compressive strength
Compressive strength or compression strength is the capacity of a material or structure to withstand loads tending to reduce size,as opposed to tensile strength,which withstands loads tending to elongate.In other words,compressive strength resists compression (being pushed together),whereas tensile strength resists tension (being pulled apart).compressive strength of basalt with mbacompressive strength of basalt with mba &gt; Продукты Мобильная дробилка Стационарная дробилка Мельница Грохот &amp; Пескомойка Мобильная щековая дробилка.
