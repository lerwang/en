## Raw materials
Raw materials are extracted from the quarry,then crushed and ground as necessary to provide a fine material for blending.Most of the material is usually ground finer than 90 microns the fineness is often expressed in terms of the percentage retained on a 90 micron sieve.Once the the raw materials are ground fine enough,they are blended in.Cement Standards and Concrete StandardsASTM's cement and concrete standards are instrumental in the evaluation and testing of concrete,cement,and aggregates.Concrete can have different properties depending upon the mixture that is used in creating it,which contains cement,chemical admixtures,and aggregates.
