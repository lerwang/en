## Mining Water for all
Mining produces mainly tailings (the waste materials left after the valuable ore is separated out) and overburden (the waste materials removed to reach the ore).During the mining process,water within and around the mine is usually contaminated,so treating the mine water before it is discharged back into the environment is a major issue [2].CDCThe controls discussed in this handbook range from long utilized controls that have developed into industry standards to newer controls that are still being optimized.The intent was to identify the best practices that are available to control respirable dust levels in underground and surface coal mining …

## A Brief Introduction to the Types of Surface Mining …
These surface mining methods are considered to be more efficient and economical in extracting minerals as compared to most methods of underground mining.In fact,it can extract almost 90% of ore from a deposit.For this reason,surface mining is the most widely used method in North America.MiningMining is the process by which commercially valuable mineral resources are extracted (removed) from Earth's surface.These resources include ores (minerals usually containing metal elements),precious stones (such as diamonds),building stones (such as granite),and solid fuels (such as coal).
