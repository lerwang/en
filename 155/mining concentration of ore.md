## Pre concentration of ore Metso
Pre concentration is the rejection of gangue (barren material) from coarse ore feed.It increases the grade of the ore early in the mining process and avoids feeding.Copper Mining and Processing: Processing of Copper,Since each mine site is unique in its mineral composition,concentration,and quantities,the most economical and profitable processing of ore must be determined by the mine planners When it is economically feasible,a mine may extract both types of copper minerals; when it is not possible,mines will only process either the copper,
