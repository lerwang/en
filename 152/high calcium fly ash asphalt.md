## EVALUATION OF LIGNITE FLY ASH AS A MINERAL FILLER …
The optimum asphalt content was determined for four separate fly ash as well as another containing 1% hydrated lime.Tests were also made to determine voids and resistance to water.The test data and conclusions are valid for the particular overall aggregate filler gradation and aggregate asphalt system.Coal Fly AshLignite or subbituminous fly ash contains up to 30 percent or more calcium,compared with anthracite or bituminous fly ash,which may only contain 4 to 6 percent of calcium.The use of high calcium fly ash may improve asphalt stripping with many aggregates,although there is not a great amount of field performance data to corroborate this assumption.
