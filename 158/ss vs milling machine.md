## Machining
Machine tools should be rigid and used to no more than 75% of their rated capacity.Both workpiece and tool should be held rigidly; tool overhand should be minimized.Rigidity is particularly important when machining titanium,as titanium has a much lower modulus of elasticity than either steel or nickel alloys.Used Milling Machines Vertical &amp; Horizontal CNC machinesDefinition: Milling Machines One machine but many variants.A milling machine is an essential instrument for any metal workshop.Fully automated milling machines (CNC machining centres) dominate in the series production sector.Also the knee type milling machine,the universal milling machine,the bed type milling machine or the hobbing machine to name just a few have a central …
