## wet magnetic separation process
4&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;wet magnetic separation process.The magnetic characteristics of the particle affect the force applied on it by a factor ranging from zero to approximately 05 The magnetic force applied on a particle is a direct function of the cube of its radius Hence the great importance of the size of particles In wet magnetic separation The force is a direct function of both H and dHdx
