Important chiefly in the mining of ores of iron and copper.The mining of metalliferous ores by surface mining methods is commonly designated as "open pit mining" as distinguished from the "strip mining" of coal and the "quarrying" of other nonmetallic materials such as limestone,building stone,etc.1.1 PHASES OF A MINING PROJECT ELAW1.1.3.1 Open pit mining Open pit mining is a type of strip mining in which the ore deposit extends very deep in the ground,necessitating the removal of layer upon layer of overburden and ore.In many cases,logging of trees and clear cutting or burning of vegetation above the ore deposit may precede removal of the overburden.The

## Open pit mining Wikipedia
Open pit,open cast or open cut mining is a surface mining technique of extracting rock or minerals from the earth by their removal from an open pit or borrow.This form of mining differs from extractive methods that require tunnelling into the earth,such as long wall mining.Open pit mines are used when deposits of commercially useful ore or rocks are found near the surface.Aluminium Mining,Techniques,Mines,Occurence,…Bauxite is the only ore containing 25 percent of aluminium from where the metal is extracted and commercially produced.The open pit or surface mining process is carried in this case since bauxite is mostly found near surface areas where the layers of soil contain a mixed amount of various minerals,iron oxides and titanium dioxide.
