## Fine limestone in cement
There still seems to be some confusion about whether fine limestone in cement (up to about 5% as permitted by eg: US and European standards) is an inert filler,or whether it is chemically reactive and contributes to the cement hydration products.Cement substitution by a combination of metakaolin …This study investigates the coupled substitution of metakaolin and limestone in Portland cement (PC).The mechanical properties were studied in mortars and the microstructural development in pastes by X ray diffraction,thermogravimetry analysis,mercury intrusion porosimetry and isothermal calorimetry.

## USE OF ALTERNATIVE CEMENTITIOUS MATERIALS
30&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;USE OF ALTERNATIVE CEMENTITIOUS MATERIALS.Limestone functions as a supplementary cementing material when it is finely ground with clinker into portland cement.Limestone quality should have at least 75% calcium carbonate by mass,a clay content less than 1.2% by mass,and an organic content less than 0.2% by mass.Understanding Limestone in Cement Concrete …The limestone acts as a seed crystal for the cement,better distributing the reaction products and increasing the reactivity of the cement.As there is always unhydrated cement in the concrete,this change will have no real measurable effect on the use of fly ash.The cement might have a reduced water demand,and the coarser cement gradation.

## Cement Types
What are the differences in these cement types and how are they tested,produced,and identified in practice? In the most general sense,portland cement is produced by heating sources of lime,iron,silica,and alumina to clinkering temperature (2,500 to 2,800 degrees Fahrenheit) in a rotating kiln,then grinding the clinker to a fine powder.Portland Limestone CementPortland limestone cement (PLC) has comparable performance properties to ordinary portland cement but improves the environmental performance of concrete.PLC has been used in the United States on a limited scale in accordance with ASTM C1157 for several years,but it …

## What is cement grade limestone?
Limestone and clay are heated to about 1500`C and this forms a mixture of calcium and aluminum silicates,known as portland cement.Limestone can also be crushed and mixed with cream coloured.MANUFACTURING OF CEMENTManufacture of Cement To manufacture cement first of all limestone is added into the clay in proportion of 3:1 by weight.This mixture of limestone and clay is then dried and crushed to get a fine powder called ‘raw meal’.The raw meal is then added into a rotary kiln through a hopper as shown in figure.
