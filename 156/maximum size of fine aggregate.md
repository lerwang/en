## Aggregate in Concrete
Fine aggregate should fall within gradation limits provided in ASTM C 33,Section 6.If there is a deficiency in a locally available fine aggregate,concrete may benefit from the addition of air entrainment,additional cement,or a supplemental cementitious material (SCM) to address these shortcomings.The Effect of Maximum Coarse Aggregate Size on the.6&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Figure 3.A graph of day Compressive Strength of Concrete against the ratio of size of fine aggregates to the maximum size coarse aggregates.4.Discussion The slump values increase as the maximum coarse aggregate size increases,and decreases with smaller coarse aggregate size at constant water cement ratio (Tables 1,2 and 3).
