## Coal fired power plant
1&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The basic function of the power plant is to convert energy in coal to electricity.Therefore,the first thing we should know is how much energy there is in coal.Energy content of coal is given in terms of KiloJoules (kJ) per Kilogram (kg) of coal as the Gross calorific value (GCV) or the Higher Heating value (HHV) of coal.This value can vary.
