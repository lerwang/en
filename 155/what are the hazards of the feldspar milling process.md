## Horizontal Milling,Vertical Milling
A milling machine is basically used for shaping,routing,boring,and drilling metals and other solid materials.Generally there are two categories of the milling machine which include the vertical type and the horizontal type.In order to optimize the capacity of the.Metalworking MachinesDuring heat treating operations,the metal is subjected to heating or cooling to acquire specific properties from that metal.Heat treating operations require a quench as an integral part of this process.Quenching is a process that quickly cools the metal.Liquid.
