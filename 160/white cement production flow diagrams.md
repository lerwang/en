## Manufacturing Production Process Introduction
The continuous flow manufacturing process is similar to the production line,but the products that are manufactured cannot be removed from the production line and stored,but require to have been through each process.For example,materials that are suited to continuous flow include chemicals,pharmaceuticals,and plastics.How Cement Is Made Portland Cement AssociationCement is so fine that 1 pound of cement contains 150 billion grains.The cement is now ready for transport to ready mix concrete companies to be used in a variety of construction projects.Although the dry process is the most modern and popular way to manufacture cement,some kilns in the United States use a wet process.
