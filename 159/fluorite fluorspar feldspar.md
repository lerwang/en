## Uses of Fluorite (Fluorspar)
&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Fluorite,also called fluorspar,is a mineral that consists of the compound calcium fluoride (calcium and fluorine).It is a common mineral and is often found in association with metallic minerals.It is also a common mineral in granite and other igneous rocks.It is estimated that the largest deposits of fluorite occur in South Africa,Mexico.Fluorite Crystals For SaleFluorite,also known as &quot;Fluorspar&quot;,is a collectable,halide mineral comprised of calcium and fluorine.Fluorite occurs commonly in cubic,octahedral and dodecahedral crystals in many different colors.These colors range from colorless and completely transparent to yellow,green,blue,purple,pink or black.
