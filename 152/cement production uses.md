## Energy Efficiency and Saving in the Cement Industry.
Cement accounts for 83% of total energy use in the production of non metallic minerals and 94% of CO2 emissions.Energy represents 20% to 40% of the total cost of cement production.The production of cement clinker from limestone and chalk by heating limestone to temperatures above 950°C is the main energy&nbsp;.3.3 Raw Materials for Cement ManufactureMaterials that contain more than minor (or in some cases trace) amounts of metallic elements such as magnesium,sodium,potassium,strontium,and various heavy metals cannot be used,as these will not burn off in the kiln and will negatively affect the cement.Another consideration is the reactivity,which is a function of&nbsp;.

## use of sodium sulphate in cement production
&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Re: use of sodium sulphate in cement production.Sodium sulphate can be added in PPC cement production.The aim would be to increase the early hydraulic reactivity of the cement.In PPC cement that would act as a form of alkali activation of the pozzolanic reaction of the fly ash.Cement Tracking Industry AnalysisInitial estimates suggest that cement production returned to 4.1 gigatonnes (Gt) globally in 2018,a 1% increase following annual declines of 1% during 2014‑17.China is the largest producer of cement,accounting for close to 60% of global production,followed by India at 7%.Demand trends.

## Cement Wikipedia
A cement plant consumes 3 to 6 GJ of fuel per tonne of clinker produced,depending on the raw materials and the process used.Most cement kilns today use coal and petroleum coke as primary fuels,and to a lesser extent natural gas and fuel oil.
