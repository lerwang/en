5&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Ore is a common term for a variety of raw minerals excavated by forward mining bases before the appearance of Tiberium.Usually golden in color,it was mined by ore trucks and delivered to the furnaces of ore refineries for smelting and processing into usable forms.The term ore as used for the resource refers to those raw materials designated in the command interface as valuable minerals in.geology13&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;This does not necessarily mean that you directly see the ore deposit in front of your eyes.Many ore forming systems are accompanied by different kinds of alteration (for example potassic or argillic alteration) that are not too hard to see in the field.Once you see them,there is a possibility that an ore deposit is nearby.
