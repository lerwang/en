Most of the iron ore bodies in the QF are hosted in itabirite of the Paleoproterozoic Cau&#234; Formation,Itabira Group.Itabirite is the protore of the iron ore and is similar in lithology to most major oxide facies of BIFs known worldwide ().ItabiriteItabirite,also known as banded quartz hematite and hematite schist,is a laminated,metamorphosed oxide facies iron formation in which the original chert or jasper bands have been recrystallized into megascopically distinguishable grains of quartz and the iron is present as thin layers of hematite,magnetite,or martite (pseudomorphs of hematite after magnetite).
