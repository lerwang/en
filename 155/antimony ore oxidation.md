## Process Flow Sheet for Gold and Antimony Recovery from …
To avoid the adverse effects of antimony on the cyanide leaching process used for the recovery of gold from refractory gold ore,a cleaner production process was proposed that would selectively.AntimonyAntimony is not common.It is found about as often as thallium.It is quite easy to get,though and is in many minerals.Antimony is sometimes found as an element,but normally it is found as stibnite,an antimony sulfide mineral.Stibnite is the main ore of antimony.of antimony.

## Antimony
Dayaldas T.Meshri,in Advanced Inorganic Fluorides,200020.11.1 Antimony trifluoride Antimony trifluoride and antimony pentafluoride are the only two antimony compounds of commercial significance.Although antimony forms stable mixed halides such as SbCl 4 F,SbCl 3 F 2,SbCl 2 F 3,SbClF 4,Sb 2 F 11 and polymer (SbCl 4 F) 4,these forms have remained a laboratory curiosity.AntimonyAntimony is not readily convertible between its two cationic forms under neutral conditions (ATSDR,1992).Antimony is geochemically found in the common ore stibnite,which is primarily Sb2S3.The substance has been used since antiquity as a cosmetic
