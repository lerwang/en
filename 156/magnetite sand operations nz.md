## Extractive metallurgy of vanadium containing …
Many technologies exist for the treatment of titaniferous magnetites that contain vanadium.Each process is designed based on the relative amounts of titanium,vanadium and iron.In some cases,steelmaking is the primary purpose followed by the secondary recovery of vanadium.In others,the vanadium is the main product.This paper presents a review of these technologiesCase StudyCase Study South Taranaki Bight iron sand extraction.Iron sands are the largest known reserve of metalliferous ore in New Zealand.Iron sand is a general term for sand sized grains of heavy iron rich minerals,principally magnetite (Fe3O4),titanomagnetite (Fe2TiO3),and ilmenite (FeTiO3).
