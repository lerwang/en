## Mesh specifications of woven wire mesh
Interpretation of Mesh Specifications It is worth noting that working in aperture size is,typically,far more useful than talking in terms of mesh count.This is because the aperture size of any given mesh count will depend on the wire diameter used to weave it.ForMicron to mesh to inch to millimeter conversion tables2019 9 21&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Micron to mesh to inch to millimeter conversion tables.Enquries to aqua@ecotao.co.za.Micron mesh tables.Use the below tables to convert between micron,mesh,millimeter and inch units.A mesh could have a specification such as “POLYESTER 65 37”.This would be a 65 micron square hole and a 37 micron strand width making the mesh screen.
