## What Is the Connection between Copper and Sulfuric Acid?
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Producing electricity from copper sulfate is done using a solution of diluted sulfuric acid and anhydrous copper sulfate.Using diluted sulfuric acid will not oxidize the copper metal to be used as an electric plate.By using a copper plate,a zinc plate,and electric wires,it is possible to send the extra charge from the ions the salt makes in the weak acid to a small light bulb.How Does Acid Affect Copper? HunkerThe most common weak acid we have around the home is vinegar a five percent solution of acetic acid.Over time,copper pennies turn brown as the copper oxidizes with air.Vinegar and other weak acids such as citrus juice dissolves this layer of copper oxide.
