## What is Iron?
Open pit mining,which involves excavation from the surface,is the most common mining method,but underground mining is also used,particularly where the iron ore extends deep below the surface.(PDF) Iron Ore Pelletizing Process: An OverviewThere has been no displacement of steel plants from industrial to developing countries but there is an increase of iron ore processing operations in mining areas such as beneficiation,pelletizing.

## Mining
Mining Mining Underground mining: When any ore body lies a considerable distance below the surface,the amount of waste that has to be removed in order to uncover the ore through surface mining becomes prohibitive,and underground techniques must be considered.Counting against underground mining are the costs,which,for each ton of material mined,are much higher underground than on the.Iron ore mining in Western AustraliaIron ore mining in Western Australia,in the 17 financial year,accounted for 54 percent of the total value of the state's resource production,with a value of A$61.7 billion.The overall value of the minerals and petroleum industry in Western Australia was A$114.9 billion in 18,a 9.5 percent increase on the previous financial year.

Mining operations are complex.They aren't your run of the mill type projects.These billion dollar complexes consist of various interconnected projects,operating simultaneously to deliver refined commodities like gold,silver,coal and iron ore.It’s a five stage processHow is Iron Refined from Ore? (with pictures)&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;To create an even purer form of iron,known as pig iron,limestone must be added to the mix and the heat increased.This is done contemporarily in the silo like structure known as a blast furnace.The calcium in limestone bonds with the silicates in the ore,creating a material called slag,which floats on top of the pure liquid iron.
