## Fly ash
Fly ash material solidifies while suspended in the exhaust gases and is collected by electrostatic precipitators or filter bags.Since the particles solidify rapidly while suspended in the exhaust gases,fly ash particles are generally spherical in shape and range in size from 0.5 &#181;m to 300 &#181;m.to 300 &#181;m.Development of Dry FGD By Product Utilization as Building …Quartz sand or fly ash,lime,cement,gypsum,and water are used traditionally for production of autoclaved aerated concrete.DFGD can be used as mix component due to its compositions (contain fly ash and hydrated lime) and can function as gypsum
