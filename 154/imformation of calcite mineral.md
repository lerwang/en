## Marble: Metamorphic Rock: Pictures,Definition,Properties
What is Marble? Marble is a metamorphic rock that forms when limestone is subjected to the heat and pressure of metamorphism.It is composed primarily of the mineral calcite (CaCO 3) and usually contains other minerals,such as clay minerals,micas,quartz,pyrite,iron oxides,and graphite.CalciteCalcite also displays double refraction,this is when a ray of light enters the mineral and then splits off into two different rays.You can test this by putting the mineral over a picture and it will split the image into two,overlapping pictures.
