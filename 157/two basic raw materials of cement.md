Clay raw materials for cement production In the case when the composition of the basic raw material differs from these values various mineral additions are used Clay raw materials reduce the CaCO 3 content and increase the content of SiO 2 Al 2 O 3 and Fe 2 O 3.Cement manufacturingCement is typically made from limestone and clay or shale.These raw materials are extracted from the quarry crushed to a very fine powder and then blended in the correct proportions.This blended raw material is called the 'raw feed' or 'kiln feed' and is heated in a rotary kiln where it reaches a temperature of about 1400 C to 1500 C.

Technically,a cement producer can have almost complete control over clinker composition by blending raw materials of different compositions to produce the desired result.In practice,however,clinker composition is largely determined by the compositions of the locally available raw materials which make up the bulk of the raw meal.15+ Different Types of Cement3&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;A number of different types of cement are manufactured,by varying the ratio of the raw material and or by adding some additional materials.Some of the most common cement classifications are: 1.Ordinary Portland Cement.2.Rapid hardening cement,3.Ultra rapid hardening cement.

## Cement,concrete &amp; the circular economy
The cement making process can be divided into two basic steps: s s Clinker (the main constituent of cement) is first made in a kiln with gas up to 2000&#176;C,which heats raw materials such as limestone (calcium carbonate) with small quantities of other materialsALTERNATIVE RAW MATERIAL SOURCES FOR …ALTERNATIVE RAW MATERIAL SOURCES FOR CEMENT PRODUCTION.Cement is a complete mixture of mineral substances that gradually harden when mixed with water.It is the product of the reaction of lime with the oxides of silica alumina and iron.It is used in the construction of industry as a blending material.
