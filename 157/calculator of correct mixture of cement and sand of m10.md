A concrete mixture ratio of 1 part cement,3 parts sand,and 3 parts aggregate will produce a concrete mix of approximately 3000 psi.Mixing water with the cement,sand,and stone will form a paste that will bind the materials together until the mix hardens.Concrete Mix Ratios (Cement,Sand,Gravel)5&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Typically used as the compound for joining masonry,stone or ceramic units together,mortar is made by combining cement,lime and sand.Mortar typically has a higher water to cement ratio when compared with concrete which allows greater workability and is …
