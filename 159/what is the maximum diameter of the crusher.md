## Gyratory Crusher
The gyratory crusher can,just like a jaw crusher,accept boulder sizes close to 1.5 m (for the largest equipment). This crusher can handle products with a Mohs hardness that is not necessarily less than 5. As is the case for jaw crushers,there is not any mutual sliding on grinding surfaces,but simply rolling of the nut on concaves.AMIT 135: Lesson 5 Crushing Mining Mill Operator …Rose and Hill (1967) considered crusher capacity by determining the amount of time and distance a particle takes between two jaw plates.Particles in the A B zone discharges at the next reverse movement of the jaw.The maximum size of a particle dropping out of the crusher d max is determined by the open size setting (L max).

## Crusher
30&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Each crusher is designed to work with a certain maximum size of raw material,and often delivers its output to a screening machine which sorts and directs the product for further processing.Typically,crushing stages are followed by milling stages if the materials need to be further reduced.e CRUSHER CARBONe Crusher models benefit from our HHG technology with internal guide for the derailleur (Di2 for e Crusher Carbon RR+),rear brake cables and internal routed seatposts for both models.HHG features some external stops to attach the cables,avoiding any possible noise while preserving the most meticulous design as clean as possible.
