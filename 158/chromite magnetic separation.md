## Magnetic Separation
J.Svoboda,in Encyclopedia of Materials: Science and Technology,20052 Sources of Magnetic Field and Its Gradient in Magnetic Separators The aim of magnetic separation is to recover or remove particles with sizes ranging from several tens of millimeters down to a fraction of micrometer,with a wide spectrum of magnetic susceptibilities,from ferromagnetic to diamagnetic.Magnetic Separators For Mineral Process BuntingMagnetic separators can be found in most mineral processing operations,especially those processing non metallic minerals and magnetic ores.This article investigates the use of high intensity magnetic separators and magnetic separation equipment in the minerals sector with a focus on processing dry materials (in the mm,+45 micron size range).

## Extraction of Chromium from Chromite Ore
Magnetic Separation is the process of separating components of mixtures by using magnets to attract magnetic materials The process that is used for magnetic separation detaches non magnetic material with those who are magnetic This technique is useful for not all,but few minerals such as ferromagnetic (materials strongly affected by magnetic fields) and paramagnetic (materials that are less.Magnetic separationMagnetic separation is a physical separation of discrete particles based on the three way competition between tractive (i) magnetic forces,(ii) gravitational,hydro dynamic drag,frictional,or inertial forces,and (iii) attractive or repulsive inter particle forces.

## Magnetic separation
Magnetic separation is the process of separating components of mixtures by using magnets to attract magnetic materials.[1] The process that is used for magnetic separation detaches non magnetic material with those who are magnetic.This technique is useful for not all,but few minerals such as ferromagnetic (materials strongly affected by.
