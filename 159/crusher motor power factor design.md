## Power factor
The power factor in a single phase circuit (or balanced three phase circuit) can be measured with the wattmeter ammeter voltmeter method,where the power in watts is divided by the product of measured voltage and current.The power factor of a balanced polyphase circuit is the same as that of any phase.low power factor of crusher motor yepschoolsnlDesign C motors have high starting torque low starting current and also have low slip This the motor may have an efficiency power factor and speed slightly different from those shown on the nameplate Service factor can also be used to determine if a motor can be operated continuously at altitudes higher than 3300 feet satisfactorily.
