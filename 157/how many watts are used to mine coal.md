## The Steam Engine,the Industrial Revolution and Coal.
The history of coal use in England stretches back far earlier than the development there of the steam engine.It has been mined and used at least since the Romans occupied the island.During the Middle Ages,coal fueled the ovens of blacksmiths and artisans.Coal fired power plant24&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Many coal plants are mine mouth which means the plant was put where the coal mine is,so the coal doesn't need to be transported by train.Once unloaded,the coal is then pulverized into a fine powder by a large grinder.This ensures nearly complete burning of the coal in order to maximize the heat given off and to minimize pollutants.

John Oliver and a giant squirrel look into it.Connect with Last Week Tonight online.Why is energy in cycling measured in watts?Well I think 250 watts is about 0.335 mechanical horsepower,depending upon what sort of HP definition you use.And 0.335 not very memorable or human scale “friendly”,is it? So what other measure might you use? I guess you have options here,but.
