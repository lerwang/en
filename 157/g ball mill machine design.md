## Synthesis of Nanomaterials by High Energy Ball Milling
For all nanocrystalline materials prepared by high energy ball milling synthesis route,surface and interface contamination is a major concern.In particular,mechanical attributed contamination by the milling tools (Fe or WC) as well as ambient gas (trace impurities such as O 2,N 2 in rare gases) can be problems for high energy ball milling.Ball Mill&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Summary The Ball Mill is designed to grind materials by turning the cylindrical shell with grinding medium (e.g.steel balls) put in the shell,and has a simple structure and ease of handling.Furthermore,The Ball Mill of a large capacity has been available to a very extensive range of applications in both dry and wet 14.References 1.
