## (PDF) Recovery of Sulfur from Iron Pyrite
The reactions of natural iron pyrite with steam,hydrogen,and carbon monoxide have been studied in a fixed bed tubular reactor at 1100 C.A new process has been developed.What is the role of silica in the metallurgy of co toppr.comDuring the roasting of pyrite ore,a mixture of FeO and Cu2O is obtained.The role of silica in the metallurgy of copper is to remove the iron oxide obtained during the process of extraction of pure copper from copper pyrite,SiO2 acts as acidic flux which combines

## How to Separate Gold from Pyrite
So far no account has been taken of the loss of gold which is contained in pyrites,as it has been assumed that these are saved by concentration if they are valuable,and this subject is dealt with in earlier.Nevertheless,as this gold comes under the head of non amalgamable gold,its physical state and the causes of its disinclination to unite with mercury may conveniently be considered here.The Extraction of IronCast iron has already been mentioned above.This section deals with the types of iron and steel which are produced as a result of the steel making process.Wrought iron: If all the carbon is removed from the iron to give high purity iron,it is known as wrought

## Extraction of Iron : Processes and Procedure
The extraction of iron from its ores is quite a technical process.The iron ore is first roasted in air to produce iron(III)oxide which is mixed with coke and limestone and then further heated to a very high temperature in a blast furnace.These materials are loaded into.Extraction of Aluminum,Copper,Zinc &amp; IronExtraction of Copper Chalcopyrite (CuFeS 2) is the commonest copper ore.Copper is mainly extracted from the sulphide ore (Cu 2 S) by the self reduction process.The ores are often low grade (0.5%.
