Slag happens when iron ore is melted The molten iron sinks to the bottom,while the slag will float on the top of the iron See the diagram below: Another difference between slag and fly ash is that while fly ash will rarely surpass 35% of the cement content,slag can substitute 50% of the cement content,or even higher for different applicationsBEGINNINGS OF IRON SMELTING IN THE CENTRAL,BEGINNINGS OF IRON SMELTING IN THE CENTRAL,Košice,Slovakia ABSTRACT The paper presents information about early methods of iron smelting in the Central Carpathians region Presented facts are based on study of early iron smelting furnaces,Remnants of slag pit shaft furnaces,slag cakes,were found in east Slovakia,near the confluence.

## Magnetic investigations of Iron Age slags at Yderik.
SW Jutland,Denmark,was a major centre for iron smelting from 2nd to 7th centuries AD.With no visible remnants of the iron smelting above ground,magnetic surveying of a field at Yderik detected more than 50 buried slags,each the product of a furnace used only once.Janney Furnace Encyclopedia of AlabamaAccording to experts who have studied the Janney furnace's remains,it is unlikely that any iron was actually produced there The lining of the stack was not fire blackened,and examinations of the area and the furnace itself have found no remnants of charcoal or slag,

## Mineral Resource of the Month: Iron and Steel Slag EARTH,
Iron and steel slag,also known as ferrous slag,is produced by adding limestone (or dolomite),lime and silica sand to blast furnaces and steel furnaces to strip impurities from iron ore,scrap and other ferrous feed materials and to lower the heat requirements of the iron and steelmaking processSlag is not just waste Science in PolandDepending on how the slag is formed,it has different uses and properti Slag formed as a result of smelting steel in hearth furnaces is used as a substitute for iron and manganese ore Slag created in the so called Thomas\'s converters (used to produce steel PAP) is a phosphoric fertilizer,so called Thomas slag
