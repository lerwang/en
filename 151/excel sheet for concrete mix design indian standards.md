The compressive strength of any material is defined as the resistance to failure under the action of compressive forces.Especially for concrete,compressive strength is an important parameter to determine the performance of the material during service conditions.Concrete mix can be designed or proportioned to obtain the required engineering.ACI mix design10&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Designing Concrete Mixtures There are three phases in the development of a concrete mixture: specifying,designing,and proportioning ACI Mix Design The most common method used in North America is that established by ACI Recommended Practice 211.1 Any mix design procedure will provide a first approximation
