## What is the mix design for M30 grade concrete?
Here,M represents ‘MIX’ and 30 represents the characteristic compressive strength of a 150 mm cube of concrete at 28 days of curing in N mm^2.The mix proportion of this grade is approximately 1:0.75:1.5 (Cement: Sand: Aggregate).A small analysi.Calculate Cement Sand Aggregate and Water for Concrete …Excess reducing of cement content or increase of sand content will adversely affect the strength of concrete.Hence it is advisable not to increase the fine aggregate (river sand and M sand) content more than 30% above the prescribed ratio in any case.
