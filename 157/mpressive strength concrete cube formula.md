The method for determining the rebound number of hardened concrete is given in ASTM C805.The uses of the rebound hammer are given in Section 5.1 of C805,which states that “this test method is applicable to assess the in place uniformity of the concrete,to delineate regions in a structure of poorer quality or deteriorated concrete,and to estimate strength.”Advanced nondestructive monitoring and evaluation …10&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Concrete Strength: 28 MPa 3 40 MPa The ASTM standard requires three firmly embedded test probes in a given test area to constitute as one test for both penetration test methods (ASTM C 97)The penetration methods are still near surface tests but do offer reliable empirical relationships between concrete strength and penetration resistance.

## Compressive strength of rocks
Estimating compressive strength.General rock failure criterion can be reduced to a few parameters dependent on lithology (m) and the uniaxial compressive strength (C 0).Lithology is commonly derived during log analysis,so m may be estimated (Table 1).What is needed still is an initial measure of rock strength provided by C 0.C 0 can be estimated from porosity or sonic velocities,but many.Compressive Strength of Concrete &amp; Concrete Cubes …The capacity of concrete is reported in psi pounds per sq.inch in US units and in MPa mega pascals in SI units.This is usually called as the characteristic compressive strength of concrete fc fck.For normal field applications,the concrete strength can vary from 10Mpa to 60 Mpa.
