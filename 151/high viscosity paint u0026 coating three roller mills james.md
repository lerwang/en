## Optimum Viscosity for Paint Application
If the viscosity is much above 100 cps,the brush drag will be so high that the painter will end up with a sore wrist and will not buy your paint again.I do not recall the ranges for roll coating,but viscosity much below 100 cps is likely to cause misting,and high viscosity probably wiPebeo High Viscosity Studio Acrylic BLICK Art MaterialsPebeo High Viscosity Studio Acrylic is the ultimate mixed media acrylic!
