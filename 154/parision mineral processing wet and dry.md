## A comparative study on the effects of dry and wet …
Water scarcity dictates to limit the use of water in ore processing plants particularly in arid regions.Since wet grinding is the most common method for particle size reduction and mineral liberation,there is a lack of understanding about the effects of dry grinding on.Processing Equipment CompanyDry mineral processing methods offer a solution to this looming problem.Wet separation methods such as froth flotation require the addition of chemical reagents that must be handled safely and disposed of in an environmentally responsible manner.
