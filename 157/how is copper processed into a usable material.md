## Zinc smelting
3&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Zinc smelting is the process of converting zinc concentrates (ores that contain zinc) into pure zinc.Zinc smelting has historically been more difficult than the smelting of other metals,e.g.iron,because in contrast,zinc has a low boiling point.At temperatures typically used for smelting metals,zinc is a gas that will escape from a.The Metal Casting Process Explained General …The oldest known metal casting is that of a copper frog,believed to have been produced in 3200 BCE in Mesopotamia when copper was a popularly used material.Later,around 2000 BCE,iron was discovered.But it was not until around 700 BCE that the first production of cast iron was developed in China.

## Jordan: Ancient Metallurgy
23&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Metal ores processed in these ways have never been significant in human history,however.(For example,compared with chipped obsidian,chipped iron ore makes a far less usable tool.) Instead,usable metal tools involve heating and or hammering the metal to work it into something usable…From Ore to Finished Product1&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Copper From Beginning to End.Copper is a major metal and an essential element used by man.It is found in ore deposits around the world.It is also the oldest metal known to man and was first discovered and used about 10,000 years ago.And as alloyed in bronze (copper tin alloy) about 3000 BC,was the first engineering material known to man.

## How iron is made
Iron ore is converted into various types of iron through several processes.The most common process is the use of a blast furnace to produce pig iron which is about 94% iron and 5% carbon with smaller amounts of other elements.Because iron was a far superior material for the manufacture of weapons and tools than any other known metal.Copper Compendium,Part 3: Primary Copper …Editor’s Note: We are dedicating each Tuesday in July and August to Copper,number 29 on the periodic table.Our previous post,Copper Compendium,Part 2: Copper is Key in the Modern Age,looked at some of the many uses of copper which,like every other metal,must be extracted,processed,and purified before it can be used.In this post we’ll examine how copper is made into usable form.
