## Properties of concrete
2&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Concrete has a very low coefficient of thermal expansion,and as it matures concrete shrinks.All concrete structures will crack to some extent,due to shrinkage and tension.Concrete which is subjected to long duration forces is prone to creep.The density of concrete varies,but is around 2,400 kilograms per cubic metre (150 lb cu ft).Density of Concrete&quot;Density Concrete 2242 kg m^3&quot; 2242 kg m 3 (conventional) Material Notes.Faculty of the Built Environment,University of New South Wales.&quot;While conventional concrete has a density of about 2300 kg m 3,lightweight concrete has a density between 1 kg m 3.&quot; 2300 kg m 3 (conventional)

AnswersDriveMaterial density,more often referred to simply as density,is a quantitative expression of the amount of mass contained per unit volume.The standard unit is the kilogram per meter cubed (kg m 3 or kg.&#183; m ).Density is sometimes expressed in grams per centimeter cubed (g cm 3 or gm.

## Density of Hydraulic Cement
density lower than portland conventional cement (a mixture of ground cement clinker and gypsum).The commonly assumed density of 3150 kg m 3 (3.15 g cm 3) for portland cement [ 4] will not be correct when limestone is interground into the cement.Neither ASTM C150 nor ASTM C595 requires the density to be reported or measured.Density Of ConcreteDensity is simply a mass to volume ratio.Perhaps the easiest and most accurate way to calculate the concrete density is to measure some into a container of known volume and weighing it.One value of understanding,knowing,and monitoring the density of concrete is …
