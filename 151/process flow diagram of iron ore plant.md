## Ore processing Waihi Gold
Ore processing is a 24 hour operation.Ore is stockpiled (1) at the processing plant,and the process begins by feeding the ore into a hopper with a loader.The ore is conveyed,and lime is added (2) to raise the pH of the ore.KOBELCO Pelletizing Process6&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;iron ore.His process involved grinding taconite to remove gangues and upgrading the iron ore (i.e.an ore beneficiation process).The resultant high grade ore is in the form of fine particles,as small as 0.1mm or less,which are not suitable for sintering.This issue led to the use of pelletizing.Pelletizing plants are expected to play an
