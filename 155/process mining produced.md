## Mining
Mining is the process of digging things out of the ground.Any material that cannot be grown must be mined.Mining things from the ground is called extraction.Mining can include extraction of metals and minerals,like coal,diamond,gold,silver,platinum,copper,tin and iron.Mining can also include other things like oil and natural gas.Wastewater treatment in mining industryWastewater treatment in mining industry.A mine generates large amounts of highly concentrated wastewater due to contact between water and various types of minerals.A mine generates large amounts of highly concentrated wastewater due to contact between.

## The Aggregate Manufacturing Process General Kinematics
Mining equipment is now more efficient,saves energy and reduces the number of harmful chemicals needed to extract the desired material from its surroundings.Even still,heavy duty,weather resistant equipment is necessary to extract,transport,and processCommercial Lithium Production and Mining of LithiumMost lithium is commercially produced from either the extraction of lithium containing salts from underground brine reservoirs or the mining of lithium containing rock,such as spodumene.Lithium production from clay sources is expected to become commercially viable,though perhaps not until 2022.
