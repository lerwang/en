## How to Drill Your Own Water Well
Always use the 10 foot head start method when drilling in sand.There is a page on the technique under the menu item,&quot;Drill 10 Feet Deeper&quot; for details.Basically,it just involves washing down a four inch pipe down 10 feet (or as deep as you can get it) and then using that as a well casing to hold the sand off the first 10 feet of your drillpipe.Pounding a shallow well point&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;This sand would clog the point.At one point we hit a 4 foot vein of blue marl and we went thru that like a dream.At 18 feet or so we hit what the oldtimer's called hard pan.End of story,we never got water.Check that,there was water but we couldn't recover it.On the other hand I knew a guy that had a well in a few hours.Route 66
