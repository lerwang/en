## Iron Oxide Red
During firing all irons normally decompose and produce similar colors in glazes and clay bodies (although they have differing amounts of Fe metal per gram of powder).Red iron oxide is available in many different shades from a bright light red at a deep red maroon,these are normally designated by a scale from about 180 (this number.Dispersant Technology for Red and Yellow Iron Oxides.The difficulty in iron oxides lies in the shape and not the wetting of the pigment.Iron oxide yellow tends to give dilatant rheology,which can be a disaster when automatically dosing in a dispensing machine.On the other hand,iron oxide red tends to increase in viscosity over time in pigment concentrates.
