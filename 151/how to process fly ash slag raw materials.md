## Chapter 1
Class C and F fly ashes were used in this research project.Currently,more than 50% of the concrete placed in the U.S.contains fly ash.Dosage rates vary depending on the type of fly ash and its reactivity level.Typically,Class F fly ash is used at dosages of 15% to 25% by mass of cementitious material and Class C fly ash at 15% to 40%.Fly ash or GGBS?Fly ash and ground granulated blastfurnace slag (GGBS) are regarded as conventional cement constituents in much of the world.The proportions used in concrete making vary quite considerably and the price of the material is key when it comes to producing a cubic metre of concrete to the required specification at the lowest possible cost.
