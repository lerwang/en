The basic idea is to make a magnet float by holding it up with the repelling force from another magnet.Magnets can repel each other with enough force.Having enough force to levitate it isn’t the problem.The problem is that this setup isn’t stable.The floating magnet tends to rotate around,flipping itself to attract to the other magnet.Magnetic levitation Georgia State University2016119&ensp&#0183&enspMagnetic Levitation Magnetic fields are actively excluded from superconductors (Meissner effect).If a small magnet is brought near a superconductor,it will be repelled becaused induced supercurrents will produce mirror images of each pole.If a small permanent magnet is placed above a superconductor,it can be levitated by this repulsive force.

Magnetic levitation or MAGLEV is a method by which an object is suspended in air with the support of magnetic field.The two primary issues involved in magnetic levitation are lifting forces: providing an upward force sufficient to counteract gravity,and stability: ensuring that the system does not spontaneously slide or flip into a configuration where the lift is neutralized.Magnetic Levitation learn.sparkfun.comWith magnetic levitation we need a fixed magnetic field,provided by permanent magnets,and a magnetic field that we can control to position the permanent magnets.Image courtesy of Geek3 via Wikipedia,CC BY SA 3.0.To create a magnetic field that can be controlled,we can use an inductor.Inductors store energy similar to capacitors; while.

## Maglev
22&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Maglev (derived from magnetic levitation) is a system of train transportation that uses two sets of magnets,one set to repel and push the train up off the track,and another set to move the elevated train ahead,taking advantage of the lack of friction.Along certain &quot;medium range&quot; routes (usually 320 to 640 km [200 to 400 mi]),maglev can compete favorably with high speed rail and airplanes.Magnetic levitation20&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The possibility of defying gravity by suspending or levitating objects has always fascinated man's imagination.Thanks to magnetic technology,the use of repulsive forces created by magnetic field has made it possible to create Levi Mag &#174; a display range with floating levitation,whose futuristic effect of lifting against gravity captures the attention of even the most distracted person.

## Levitating Top K&J Magnetics
To make levitation work,you need to add stability.In spin stabilized magnetic levitation,the gyroscopic forces of a spinning top seem to do the trick.Just like it’s easier to balance on a bike in motion than one standing still,the spinning of the top provides the needed stability.Review of Magnetic Levitation (MAGLEV): ATechnology to.18&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Review of Magnetic Levitation (MAGLEV): A Technology to Propel Vehicles with Magnets.α Ѡ σ.Abstract The term “Levitation” refers to a class of technologies that uses magnetic levitation to propel vehicles with magnets •rather than with wheels,axles and bearings.Maglev (derived from magnetic levitation) uses magnetic
