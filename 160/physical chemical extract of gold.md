## Chemical Properties of Gold
Gold has a wide distribution within the earth,especially in areas under the oceans and sea.It is found in the form of dust,grains,flakes,or nuggets.The chemical element of gold occurs by amalgamation of mercury and silver.It also forms telluride minerals in its compound form …Determination of Pueraria Flavonoid by Flow Injection.A method of flow injection chemiluminescence was proposed for the determination of pueraria flavonoid,based on the decreasing effect of pueraria flavonoid on Luminol H2O2 chemiluminescence sys

## Gold (Au)
Gold.Gold is metallic,with a yellow colour when in a mass,but when finely divided it may be black,ruby,or purple.It is the most malleable and ductile metal; 1 ounce (28 g) of gold can be beaten out to 300 square feet.It is a soft metal and is usually alloyed to give it more strength.Extraction of GoldThe extract is transferred to tanks,and the gold precipitated as a powder by addition of zinc.It is then washed out from the bottom of the tanks,dried,and freed from zinc by roasting and fusing.In the electrolytic precipitation of the gold an iron anode and a sheet lead cathode are employed,the current density being very low,about 0.5.

## How do you separate gold from other substances
Now that you know what gold panning is,I think you be able to answer all of the questions you presented.If you can't,then please re read your textbook where it explains physical vs.chemical properties.But,in general,physical properties are things you measure with physical devices,like weight which is measurable with a scale.Good luck.
