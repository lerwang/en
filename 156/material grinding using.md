## Machining
Machining is a term used to describe a variety of material removal processes in which a cutting tool removes unwanted material from a workpiece to produce the desired shape.The workpiece is typically cut from a larger piece of stock,which is available in a variety of standard shapes,such as flat sheets,solid bars,hollow tubes,and shaped beams.Grinding Brittle MaterialsGrinding Brittle Materials As seen in Ceramic Industry By Aggressive Grinding Service,Inc.In the industrial world,brittle materials include the range of cemented tungsten carbide grades,the entire family of advanced ceramics—including silicon carbide,silicon.

## How to fix material grinding
When material no longer comes out of the nozzle and dust is visible in the feeder,it means that the filament has been ground down.When this happens,the feeder won’t be able to forward the material anymore and will continue to grind the filament.Grinding MachinesPeel grinding operates in a similar mode removing a narrow strip of material as the grinding wheel is traversed along the programmed path.A typical operation is shown schematically in Figure 6.9.Grinding forces are minimized by using a very high speed narrow
