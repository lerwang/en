## An overview of fossil fuel energy resources of Pakistan.
At present coal constitute only 7.6 % of our primary energy supplies.Total coal resource potential of Pakistan is estimated to be around 185 billion tonnes,out of which about 175 billion tonnes are located in Thar desert,Sindh province which is the 5th largest single coal field in the world.Energy Statistics28&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;provide a comprehensive picture of Energy Sector in India.Energy Statistics is an integrated and updated database of installed capacity,production,consumption,import,export and whole reserves,sale prices of different sources viz.coal,crude petroleum,natural gas and electricity Energy Balance.
