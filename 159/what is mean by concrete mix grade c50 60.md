## Concrete Mix Design Procedure and Example IS456
Concrete mix design is the process of finding the proportions of concrete mix in terms of ratios of cement,sand and coarse aggregat For eg,a concrete mix of proportions 1:2:4 means that cement,fine and coarse aggregate are in the ratio 1:2:4 or the mix contains one part of cement,two parts of fine aggregate and four parts of coarse aggregateWhat we are understanding Grade 40 or grade 60? Bayt,The strength of concrete depends on its grade or the ratio of cement to sand or gravel when mixed with water Grade ratings such as C15,C20,C25 and C30 indicate the relative compression resistance of a concrete mixThe number in the rating indicates how many amount of force the concrete can withstand

Concrete Mix Design Definition Concrete mix design is defined as the appropriate selection and proportioning of constituents to produce a concrete with pre defined characteristics in the fresh and hardened stat In general,concrete mixes are designed in order to achieve a defined workability,strength and durabilityFarm structures, Ch3 Building materials: Concrete(1 cement 6 aggregate,by weight,060 water cement ratio) In some literature the required grade of concrete is noted by the proportions of cement sand stone,so called nominal mixes rather than the compressive strength Therefore some common nominal mixes have been included in Table 312
