## Effects of phosphate and hydrogen peroxide on the.
Generally,phosphate removal occurs with the addition of coagulants in coagulation sedimentation filtration processes,which results in phosphorus deficient water at a concentration of 0.01 mg L (Nishijima et al.1997).However,the impact of phosphorus on BAC biofilms,particularly the EPS characteristics,has not yet been fully explored.Chemical Filtration: Removing What Other Filters Can’t!Chemical filtration is one of three different types of filters that can be used in your aquarium.The other two are biological and mechanical filtration.As the name suggests,this is a filter that specifically removes chemicals from your aquarium.
