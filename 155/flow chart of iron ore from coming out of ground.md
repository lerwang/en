## IRON AND STEEL
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;This page looks at the use of the Blast Furnace in the extraction of iron from iron ore,and the conversion of the raw iron from the furnace into various kinds of steel.The common ores of iron are both iron oxides,and these can be reduced to iron by heating them with carbon in the form of coke.Iron Ore Mining Australia Industry Research Reports …The Iron Ore Mining industry has benefited from rising prices and higher production volumes over the past five years.As a result,industry revenue is expected to increase at an annualised 1.7% over the five years through 20,to $83.4 billion.However,this trend.

SciencingWhen iron is extracted from the ground in mining operations,it is in the form of ore,which is elemental iron mixed with one or more types of rock.The most common type of iron ore is hematite,but magnetite and taconite are also significant sources of this metal.

## Iron ore
[citation needed] The extent of the accessible iron ore reserves is not known,though Lester Brown of the Worldwatch Institute suggested in 2006 that iron ore could run out within 64 years (that is,by 2070),based on 2% growth in demand per year.[25] AustraliaHow steel is madeTo make steel,iron ore is first mined from the ground.It is then smelted in blast furnaces where the impurities are removed and carbon is added.In fact,a very simple definition of steel is &quot;iron alloyed with carbon,usually less than 1%.&quot; The following text is taken
