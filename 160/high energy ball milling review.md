## Ball Mill
RETSCH is the world leading manufacturer of laboratory ball mills and offers the perfect product for each application.The High Energy Ball Mill E max and MM 500 were developed for grinding with the highest energy input.The innovative design of both,the mills and the grinding jars,allows for continuous grinding down to the nano range in the shortest amount of time with only minor warming.Effects of Ball Milling Processing Conditions and Alloy.For immiscible alloy systems with high heats of mixing like Cu Nb and Cu Mo,the solubilities are extremely low and the corresponding XRD peaks will exist even after a long time of high energy ball milling [24,31].However,with the help of CuO,a vanishing of Nb reflections can be observed after 10 h of ball milling,see Figure 1 a.
