## How Copper Affects Cyanidation &amp; Leaching
Many precious metal ores contain copper minerals in various amounts.These copper minerals dissolve in cyanide solutions to a greater or lesser degree depending on the particular copper mineral or minerals present,their fineness,and the dissolving effect of the cyanide solutions.In the process of dissolution the copper combines with,or as it is termed,consumes cyanide and,if the amount.A review of the selective leaching of gold from oxidised …The ammonia cyanide leach system was first patented over 100 years ago and stands out as a unique method of selectively leaching up to 90% Au and &lt;1% Cu from oxidised copper gold ores using &lt;10% NaCN used in conventional cyanidation processes.
