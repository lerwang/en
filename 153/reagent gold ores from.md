## Gold Flotation Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
A gold carbonaceous sulphide ore from California carrying free gold yielded a 93 per cent recovery into a concentrate at 14.4:1 to ratio of concentration after conditioning with 0.50 lb.per ton of reagent 645.In each case the ore was ground to about 70 per cent minus 200 mesh and conditioned at 22 per cent solids with the reagents as indicated.新闻分类 Gold Ore Processing GuideHigh sulfide gold ore refers to 20% 30% of gold wrapped by sulfide (mainly pyrite).It is better to use gravity separation,flotation,or flotation cyanidation process.The following is an analysis of specific beneficiation tests,and introduces four commonly used gold processing methods for high sulfide gold ores.【Learn more】
