## How to Extract Precious Metals From Sulfides Sciencing
Precious metals can be found in ore deposits along with sulfur,and are known as sulfides.Cadmium,cobalt,copper,lead,molybdenum,nickel,silver,zinc,and gold and platinum group metals can be found in sulfide forms.These concentrated ore deposits are considered low grade because of the economic costs associated.Platinum groupThe platinum group metals (abbreviated as the PGMs; alternatively,the platinoids,platinides,platidises,platinum group,platinum metals,platinum family or platinum group elements (PGEs)) are six noble,precious metallic elements clustered together in the periodic table.These elements are all transition metals in the d block (groups 8,9.
