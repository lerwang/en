Sulphuric acid unites with water and alcohol in all proportions,forming transparent liquids; a white turbidity indicates lead sulphate,which becomes black with hydro sulphuric acid.Arsenic would be indicated by a yellow precipitate occurring in the diluted acid with sulphuretted hydrogen,or more rapidly by a solution of nitrate of silver (arsenite of silver).Mineral Solubility marulla (dot) comMineral Solubility Add comments This page mainly exists as a guide for mineral cleaning and preparation.For instance,let’s say you have nice Barite crystals,but they are embedded and covered over by Calcite.From the tables below you would find that but.
