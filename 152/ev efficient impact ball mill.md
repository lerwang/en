## Ball Mills
The ball mill is a tumbling mill that uses steel balls as the grinding media.The length of the cylindrical shell is usually 1 1.5 times the shell diameter (Figure 8.11).The feed can be dry,with less than 3% moisture to minimize ball coating,or slurry containing 20 40% water by weight.OUTOTEC GRINDING TECHNOLOGIESacid resistant mills for grinding in raffinate or with acid forming feed,as well as special feed and discharge arrangements and special bearing arrangements.Outotec SAG and ball mill Outotec high performance grinding mills use advanced simulation tools for the best possible process efficiency,me

## Energy efficiency
The use of tower mills as an energy efficient alternative to secondary and regrind ball milling became a common inclusion in the latter part of the previous century.Traditionally the higher energy efficiency was attributed to the difference between attrition grinding in tower mills and iPest categorisation of potato virus Y (non‐EU isolates.Abstract Following a request from the EU Commission,the Panel on Plant Health has addressed the pest categorisation of non‐EU isolates of potato virus Y (PVY).The information currently available.
