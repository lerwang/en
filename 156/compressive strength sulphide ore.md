The flexural strength and compressive strength of concrete,with iron ore decreased as a percentage increase in the replacement of iron ore.This can be concluded 40 % was not capable to be used but there may be some condition that need for this percentage.Compressive strengthCompressive strength or compression strength is the capacity of a material or structure to withstand loads tending to reduce size,as opposed to tensile strength,which withstands loads tending to elongate.In other words,compressive strength resists compression (being pushed together),whereas tensile strength resists tension (being pulled apart).
