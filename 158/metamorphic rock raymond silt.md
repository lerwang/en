## Rock Classification
This occurs when rock is altered by coming into contact with molten rock.Rocks formed in this way are considered nonfoliated metamorphic rocks.these rocks are composed of crystals.Some changes that occur to a metamorphic rock are that minerals increase in size (recrystallization),distortion,become more dense and decrease pore space,and mineral banding.Metamorphic rocks A1 Sample answerMetamorphic rocks are formed when the appearance,texture and chemical composition of igneous or.oxides,silt,sand and clay,marble will look discoloured.For example,famous Connemara marble is green and Cork marble is red.Sandston changes into.
