The two gold refining methods most commonly employed to derive pure gold are: the Miller process and the Wohlwill process The Miller process uses gaseous chlorine to extract impurities when gold is at melting point; impurities separate into a layer on the surface of the molten purified goldGold Smelting Process SciencingThe first step in the gold smelting process occurs when ore containing gold is mined from the earth.At this point,the crude binding matter and the gold metal need to be separated.This is accomplished by pulverizing or crushing the gold ore,and then placing it in a furnace.
