## Iron Ore
1&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted.The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in colour from dark grey,bright yellow,deep purple,to rusty red.The iron itself is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe3O4),hematite (Fe2O3),goethite,limonite or …Iron Oxide RedThis can be easily remedied by proper powder gear.One needs to make sure that their mouth and nose are properly covered and so are their eyes.Mixing of the powder with other liquids should also be done with caution just like handling any other substance.We can see that there is a never ending list of uses that iron oxide red has.

## Magnetite Black Iron Oxide (Fe304) Powder
9&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Magnetite is a natural iron oxide magnet,hence the name,giving it a very nice distinguishing characteristic.Magnetite is the most magnetic of all the minerals on Earth.Magnetite is a member of the spinel group which has the standard formula A(B)2O4.The A and B represent different metal ions that occupy specific sites in the crystal structure.Iron Oxide BlackSynthetic black iron is fluffier and lighter than synthetic red iron oxide (a bag of black iron is much larger than a bag of red).It is a very fine powder,100% will easily wash through a 325 mesh screen.Synthetic black iron does not agglomerate as badly as red iron,thus it disperses in glaze slurries better (thus avoiding fired speckle).
