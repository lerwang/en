## Cement hydration
Resistance to sulfate attack is increased by modifying the cement powder.Replacing the aluminate with ferrite reduces the amount of ettringite formed during hydration,and also lowers the amount of free lime.Addition of pozzolanic materials,such as fly ash,also reduce sulfate attack because they react with the CH in cement,and render it.Cement2 &ensp;&#0183;&ensp;A cement is a binder,a substance used for construction that sets,hardens,and adheres to other materials to bind them together.Cement is seldom used on its own,but rather to bind sand and gravel together.Cement mixed with fine aggregate produces mortar for masonry,or with sand and gravel,produces concrete.Concrete is the most widely used material in existence and is only behind water as.
