## Why Use Crushed Rock In Substation
Why Crushed Rock is used at the earth surface in the 26&#183; We always see crushed rock spread on the surface of soil in the substation.The resistivity of gravel is approximately 2000 ohm meter whereas the soil resistivity is only 100 ohm meter.We saycrushed rock in substationsInsulating gravel vs coarse subgrade gravel Electric,The insulating crushed rock layer increases the allowable touch potential You can use lower resistivity rock,or even no rock if you design the ground grid for a lower allowable touch potential You can use lower.
