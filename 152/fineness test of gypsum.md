## Fineness Test on Cement Concrete Flow Measurement
Fineness Test on Cement The fineness of cement has an important bearing on the rate of hydration and hence on the rate of gain of strength and also on the rate of evolution of heat Finer cement offers a greater surface area for hydration and hence faster the development of strength,This excess of gypsum leads to an expansion and.Fineness of Cement8&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The fineness of cement affects hydration rate,and in turn,the strength.Increasing fineness causes an increased rate of hydration,high strength,and high heat generation.Bleeding can be reduced by increasing fineness.However,increased fineness can also lead to the requirement of more water for workability,resulting in a higher.
