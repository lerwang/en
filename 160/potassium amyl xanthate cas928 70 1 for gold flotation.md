## Flotation Regents For Gold
Flotation reagents.Application : Potassium iso amyl xanthate is a most powerful collector of xanthate,widely used in flotation of sulfide ores,especially for the flotation treatment of Cu Ni compound sulfide ore as well as gold mine associate with pyrite.RemarkEucalyptus oils as green collectors in gold flotation.It was found that Eucalyptus oils have the potential to replace potassium amyl xanthate as a collector in free gold flotation.The collecting power of Eucalyptus oils is correlated to the percentage of non polar and weakly polar constituents,and in particular 1,cineole,phellendrene and pipertone.
