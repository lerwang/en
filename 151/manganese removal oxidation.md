## Manganese Removal
Existing Methods Of Removal.Most methods of removal rely on the oxidation of Mn(II) to Mn(IV) to precipitate out the manganese for subsequent removal through a filter bed of sand.The capital cost of these system based on sand beds can be very high and mean treatment at multiple bore holes or surface water is just not viable.Manganese Introduction to ChemistryManganese is a silvery gray metal that resembles iron.It is hard and very brittle,difficult to fuse,but easy to oxidize.Manganese metal and its common ions are paramagnetic.Oxidation States of Manganese.The most common oxidation states of manganese are 2+,3+,4+,6+,and 7+.Mn 2+ often competes with Mg 2+ in biological systems.
