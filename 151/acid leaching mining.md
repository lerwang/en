## Acid leaching of heavy metals from contaminated soil.
The leaching behavior of C7o,As,and Hg from Site C soil using HCl acid was studied kinetically to understand the rate processes by which the acid leaching of target metals occurs from soil.The evaluation of the leaching rate usually generates valuable information about the interactions between the metal ions,the leaching agent,and the soil.Microbial Leaching (Bioleaching,Biomining.Microbial Leaching (Bioleaching,Biomining) Microbial leaching is the process by which metals are dissolved from ore bearing rocks using microorganisms.For the last 10 centuries,microorganisms have assisted in the recovery of copper dissolved in drainage from water.

## Uranium processing
Uranium processing Uranium processing Leaching: Roasted uranium ores are leached of their uranium values by both acidic and alkaline aqueous solutions.For the successful operation of all leaching systems,uranium must either be initially present in the more stable hexavalent state or be oxidized to that state in the leaching process.Acid leaching is commonly performed by agitating an ore.Study on Humic Acid for Leaching Effect of Cadmium in Soil.In order to investigate the remediation of humic acid on heavy metal cadmium(Cd) in soil,simulation experiment of soil column leaching and adsorption desorption method were used in terms of different dosages of humic acid and the effects on adsorption desorption.
