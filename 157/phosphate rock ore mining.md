## Mineral Resource of the Month: Phosphate Rock …
As a mineral resource,“phosphate rock” is defined as unprocessed ore and processed concentrates that contain some form of apatite,a group of calcium phosphate minerals that is the primary source for phosphorus in phosphate fertilizers,which are vital to agriculture.MiningThe Mining Process.The mining process in Florida begins with a field study to determine the location and density of the phosphate deposits.Information like the location,size,and shape of the ore is determined to focus the mining effort.Hundreds of boreholes are drilled and thousands of core samples studied and tested to gather information.

## Processing
In Florida,after the phosphate rock is extracted,the ore is dumped into a pit at the mine site,and high pressure water guns turn it into slurry.The slurry is pumped to a beneficiation plant.At the processing plant,the slurry mixture goes through a two step process to separate the phosphate rock …Phosphate Mining21&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Most mining of phosphate rock involves clearing large swaths of vegetation and digging up the soil beneath to reach the phosphate ore containing matrix 60 to 80 feet below the surface.This matrix is then transported by pipeline to a nearby plant,where the phosphate ore is forcibly separated from the sand and clay by a process known as.
