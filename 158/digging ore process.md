## The Mining Process
The Mining Process The mining process in Florida begins with a field study to determine the location and density of the phosphate deposits.Information like the location,size,and shape of the ore is determined to focus the mining effort.Hundreds of boreholes are.Environmental Risks of MiningThere is no ore dust or direct ore exposure to the environment and a lower consumption of water is needed in the mining process (International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA],2005) However,the strong acids used to dissolve the ore body commonly dissolve metals in the host rock as well
