## ATTRITOR GRINDING MILLS AND NEW DEVELOPMENTS
A useful and simple equation describing the grinding momentum is M x V (mass x velocity),which enables us to see how the Attritor fits into the family of mills.For example,ball mills use large media,normally 1 2” or larger,and run at a low (10 50) rpm.The other mills,such asGraphite Mining&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Graphite Processing secrets.With the growing interest in the Graphite industry and more new players entering the mining sector with their eyes focused on graphite it is becoming important to shed.
