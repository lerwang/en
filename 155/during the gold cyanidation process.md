## The Ultimate Guide of Gold Cyanidation
The cyanidation gold extraction process is the main method for extracting gold from ores or concentrates,which is mainly divided into two processes,namely,tank leaching cyanidation method and heap leaching cyanidation method.The heap leaching method is mainly used to treat low grade gold …The Metallurgy of Cyanide Gold Leaching An Introduction …Leaching gold with a cyanide solution remains the most widely used hydrometallurgical process for the extraction of gold from ores and concentrates.Despite the difficulties and hazards of working with cyanide,no other process has yet been proven to be an
