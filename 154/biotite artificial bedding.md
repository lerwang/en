## A Parabolic Failure Criterion for Transversely Isotropic Rock: …
It is of great significance to develop a failure criterion that can describe the orientation dependent behavior of transversely isotropic rocks.This paper presents a simplified parabolic model that is successful in predicting the strengths of rocks under different confining pressures and bedding angles.The model is a modified version of the normal parabolic criterion for intact rocks.The.The Preparation of Illustrations for Reports of the United …The Project Gutenberg EBook of The Preparation of Illustrations for Reports of the United States Geologi,by John L.Ridgway This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with almost no restrictions whatsoever.You may copy it,give it away or re use.
