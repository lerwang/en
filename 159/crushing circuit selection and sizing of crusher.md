## Crushers an overview ScienceDirect Topics
The key factor for the performance of a cone type secondary crusher is the profile of the crushing chamber or cavity.Therefore,there is normally a range of standard cavities available for each crusher,to allow selection of the appropriate cavity for the feed material in question.Crusher an overview ScienceDirect Topics6.2.3 Roll crusher circuit design.Roll crushers are generally not used as primary crushers for hard ores.Even for softer ores,such as chalcocite and chalcopyrite,they have been used as secondary crushers.Choke feeding is not advisable as it tends to produce particles of irregular size.Both open and closed circuit crushing is employed.

## Selecting the Right Crusher for Quarry Operations Agg Net
Like the jaw crusher,the cone crusher provides a relatively low cost crushing solution,but there are application drawbacks which may make another crushing solution more appealing.First,cone crushers cannot accept all material sizes.Any material fed to the crusher must be pre sized for that particular crusher (usually 200mm or less).Crushing CircuitOre mineralogy affects the shape and size distribution of iron ore particles.In the same crushing circuit,friable ore textures tend to generate more fine materials.Ore particles of different mineralogical characteristics also tend to have different physical characteristics and are subject to different breakage mechanisms when crushed.
