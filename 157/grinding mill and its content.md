## Cement mill
A Ball mill is a horizontal cylinder partly filled with steel balls (or occasionally other shapes) that rotates on its axis,imparting a tumbling and cascading action to the balls.Material fed through the mill is crushed by impact and ground by attrition between the balls.The grinding media are usually made of high chromium steel.The smaller.Cement Manufacturing Process: What is Cement made of.The preliminary grinding is achieved by using a gyratory type of crushers whereas for fine grinding use is made of tube mills.The tube mill crushers are generally provided with air separators through which material of desired fineness can only pass.The coarser,portion of the cement is fed back into the mill for further grinding.
