## Milling Speed and Feed Calculator
Determine the spindle speed (RPM) and feed rate (IPM) for a milling operation,as well as the cut time for a given cut length.Milling operations remove material by feeding a workpiece into a rotating cutting tool with sharp teeth,such as an end mill or face mill.Cutting Speed and Cutting Velocity in MachiningDuring machining,cutting velocity (one of the important process parameters) can be applied in four distinct ways,as listed below.Rotating workpiece (For example,lathe operations).Rotating tool (For example,milling,drilling,and grinding operations).
