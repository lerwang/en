Cone Crushers.A Cone Crusher is a compression type of machine that reduces material by squeezing or compressing the feed material between a moving piece of steel and a stationary piece of steel.Final sizing and reduction is determined by the closed side setting or the gap between the twoWhat is a Cone Crusher? (with picture)&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;The cone crusher is powered by either electrical or diesel engines that turn a belt drive turbine.These are very powerful motors,because a great deal of force is needed to crush rocks.A cone crusher's belt drive turns a central axle called the shaft,which travels in an oblong,eccentric pattern and is attached to the mantle.

Cone Crusher Applications A general rule of thumb for applying Cone Crushers is the reduction ratio.A crusher with coarse style liners would typically have a 6:1 reduction ratio.Thus,with a 3⁄4” closed side setting,the maximum feed would be 6 x 3⁄4 or 4.5 inches.Cone CrusherCone crushers are used in AG and SAG grinding circuits to increase tonnage by effectively dealing with any pebble (critical size) build up problem.Normally,heavy duty short head crushers are employed to crush pebbles.Power and crusher cavity level are the key variables for monitoring and controlling the crusher operation.
