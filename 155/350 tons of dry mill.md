## How to Calculate Pulp Density Sciencing
Dry the pulp in the container.Allow the pulp to air dry,ensuring that none of the fibrous material is lost during the drying process.Weigh the container with the dried pulp once all moisture has evaporated.Record the total weight and subtract the base weight of the container.The difference between the two provides the weight of the dry pulp.The Kraft Recovery ProcessFor every ton of pulp produced,the kraft pulping process produces about 10 tons of weak black liquor or about 1.5 tons of black liquor dry solids that need to be processed through the chemical recovery process.This paper discusses the basic steps in the kraft recovery process,problem
