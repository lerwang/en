## The Cement Manufacturing Process
Read PGNAA Improves Process and Quality Control in Cement Production to learn what makes PGNAA particularly suited for cement analysis.Accurate cement production also depends on belt scale systems to monitor output and inventory or regulate product loadout,as well as tramp metal detectors to protect equipment and keep the operation running smoothly.QatranaPortland Cement is made primarily from a combination of a calcareous material,such as limestone or chalk,and of silica and alumina found as clay or shale.The manufacturing process consists essentially of grinding the raw materials into a very fine powder,mixing.
