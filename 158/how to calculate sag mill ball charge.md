## TECHNICAL NOTES 8 GRINDING R.P.King Mineral Tech
The motion of an individual ball in the charge is complicated in practice and it is not possible to calculate the path taken by a particular particle during station of the charge.However the general pattern of the motion of the media can be simulated by discrete element methods which provide valuable information about the dynamic conditions.
