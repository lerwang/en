Why so? 2.Preferred location of the take upBelt Conveyor Dynamic Characteristics and Influential …This paper uses the Kelvin Voigt viscoelastic model to establish the continuous dynamic equations for tail hammer tension belt conveyors.The viscoelastic continuity equations are solved using the generalized coordinate method.We analyze various factors influencing longitudinal vibration of the belt conveyor by simulation and propose a control strategy to limit the vibration.
