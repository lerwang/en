## Aggregate Demand in Keynesian Analysis …
Aggregate Demand in Keynesian Analysis The Keynesian perspective focuses on aggregate demand.The idea is simple: firms produce output only if they expect it to sell.Thus,while the availability of the factors of production determines a nation’s potential GDP,the amount of goods and services actually being produced and sold,i.e.real GDP,depends on how much demand exists across the economy.The Keynesian TheoryThe Keynesian theory of the determination of equilibrium output and prices makes use of both the income‐expenditure model and the aggregate demand‐aggregate supply model,as shown in Figure.Suppose that the economy is initially at the natural level of real GDP that corresponds to Y 1 in Figure.

An alternative is the Keynesian aggregate supply curve.An aggregate supply curve is a graphical representation of the relation between real production and the price level.Classical economics implies that the full employment level of real production is maintained regardless of the price level,which creates a vertical,or perfectly elastic,aggregate supply curve.Keynesian Theory of Employment: Introduction,Features,…ADVERTISEMENTS: In this article we will discuss about: 1.Introduction to Keynesian Theory 2.Features of Keynesian Theory of Employment 3.Assumptions 4.Variables 5.Summary 6.Determination of Equilibrium Level 7.Theory of Income and Output 8.

The Keynesian theory has an implication from the policy point of view.Since in the Keynesian model,the AS curve is upward sloping in the short run,economic policies (such as monetary and fiscal policies) that increase aggregate demand succeed in increasing output and employment,from Y 0 to Y 1 and Y F,shown in Fig.12.Introduction of the Keynesian short run aggregate …Within the Keynesian framework,the aggregate supply (AS) curve is drawn horizontally.This is done because prices are sticky in the short run,represented by the flat line (prices don’t change).Because this only occurs in the very short run,we label this the
