## Crusher
A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks,gravel,sand or rock dust.Crushers may be used to reduce the size,or change the form,of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled,or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore),so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.Cone Crushers AggretekCone Crusher Application Usually,a cone crusher is installed in a crushing circuit as a secondary crusher.Pre crushed material fed in via the top of the cone crusher flows over the mantle while the vertical cone crusher drive shaft rotates the mantle.
