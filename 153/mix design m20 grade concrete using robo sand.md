For example,in M20 grade concrete M stands for “Mix” and 20 is the strength of concrete in terms of Newton per millimetre square at the end of 28 days if the concrete is properly cured.Concrete mix ratios are prescribed ratio of cement,sand and aggregate to get the desired strength of concrete.Nominal Mix and Design Mix of Concrete: Know the DifferenceDec 16,2019&#0183;&#32;A design mix concrete is preferred over a nominal mix concrete especially where the concrete is above M20 grade and also where the requirement is of the different workability and risk of deviation It is used in the large projects to get asserted of the assurance of strength,durability and workability
