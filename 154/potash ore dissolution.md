## Desliming of potash ores
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Potash froth flotation is a conventional process for recovering potash values from ore pulps.Potash ores mined in the United States and Canada normally contain between about 50 percent sylvite (KCl).Other components of potash ore can include carnallitepotash ores mexicoMost potash products are concentrated by flotation,selective dissolution of the gangue minerals,or precipitation of the mineral from hot brine.The majority of sylvinite ores,mixtures of KCl and NaCl,mined in New Mexico,are processed in grinding,desliming,sylvite flotation,and drying circuits to produce directly marketable KCl fertilizer.

## Potash
Potash ores are typically rich in potassium chloride (KCl),sodium chloride (NaCl) and other salts and clays,and are typically obtained by conventional shaft mining with the extracted ore ground into a powder.[12] Other methods include dissolution mining andGrade 7: Earth’s Crust and Resources Lesson: Potash Solution …dissolution in water.The students will carry out activities to simulate the work of a Chemical.If we place the potash ore in water then the salts (potash) will dissolve and can be separated from the insoluble portion of the ore.Materials: Clear glass canning jar.
