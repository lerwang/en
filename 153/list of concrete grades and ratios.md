The strength of concrete is divided into twelve grades,such as C7.5,C10,C15,C20,C25,C30,C35,C40,C45,C50,C55,C60 and so on.The concrete mix ratio refers to the proportion of the components in concrete (cement,water,sand,and stone).Grade of ConcreteGrade of Concrete is the classification of concrete according to its compressive strength.For making concrete we use cement,sand,aggregate,and water which are mixed with certain ratio and concrete is cast and put in a cube of 150 mm size and put in a water bath for 28 days and afterward,it is tested in a compression test.

## Concrete Mix Ratio: What Is It? What Is 1 2 3?,And More,
Jul 16,2020&#0183;&#32;A concrete mix ratio is usually expressed by a set of numbers separated by colons,as is the case with a 1:2:3 ratio This tells the mixer that they need to add 1 part cement powder,2 parts sand,and 3 parts aggregate in order to create the desired concrete consistency Water is not included in these ratios,though,because it can vary more.Concrete mix ratio Table concrete grade types Civil SirConcrete mix ratio for floor As we know that floor is non RCC structure so we can use minimum grade of M75 grade and concrete mix ratio 1:4:8 for floor & grade of concrete m10 & M15 are also used for floor 1:4:8 (m75),1:3:6 (m10) and 1:2:5 (m15) is concrete mix ratio,

## Grade of Concrete
Grade of Concrete is the classification of concrete according to its compressive strength.For making concrete we use cement,sand,aggregate,and water which are mixed with certain ratio and concrete is cast and put in a cube of 150 mm size and put in a water.
