## Rawmill
A raw mill is the equipment used to grind raw materials into &quot;rawmix&quot; during the manufacture of cement.Rawmix is then fed to a cement kiln,which transforms it into clinker,which is then ground to make cement in the cement mill.The raw milling stage of the process effectively defines the chemistry (and therefore physical properties) of the finished cement,and has a large effect …Best energy consumptionThe principle of the new generation of vertical mill was to direct higher pressure from the grinding element to the material bed using hydraulic systems.From this approach the roller press,CKP (pre grind vertical rollers) and Horomill all developed.Raw milling
