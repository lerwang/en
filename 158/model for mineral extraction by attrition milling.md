## Ball mill
A ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind,blend and sometimes for mixing of materials for use in mineral dressing processes,paints,pyrotechnics,ceramics and selective laser sintering.It works on the principle of impact and attrition: size reduction is done by impact as the balls drop from near the top of the shell.A ball mill.Introduction to Mineral ProcessingIntroduction to Mineral Processing Froth Flotation Froth flotation is considered to be the most widely used method for ore beneficiation.In ore beneficiation,flotation is a process in which valuable minerals are separated from worthless material or other valuable.

## Mineral Extraction
Mineral extraction sites,which include strip mines,quarries,and underground mines,contribute to surface water and groundwater pollution,erosion,and sedimentation (see Chapter 14).The mining process involves the excavation of large amounts of waste rock).Mill (grinding)A mill is a device that breaks solid materials into smaller pieces by grinding,crushing,or cutting.Such comminution is an important unit operation in many processes.There are many different types of mills and many types of materials processed in them.Historically mills were powered by hand (e.g.via a hand crank),working animal (e.g.
