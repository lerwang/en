## Gyratory Crusher
Figure 8.1 shows two basic types of jaw crushers: single toggle and double toggle.In the single toggle jaw crusher,an eccentric shaft is installed on the top of the crusher.Shaft rotation causes,along with the toggle plate,a compressive action of the moving jaw.A double toggle crusher has,basically,two shafts and two toggle plates.Jaw Crusher Conmix CrusherSingle Toggle&#194; Jaw&#194; Crushers &#194;&#174; &#194; are uses only one toggle plate in its mechanism.Two bearings are fit in the swing jaw of this Crusher and the other two bearings support the eccentric shaft,which is driven by the drive flywheel.An extra (non drive) flywheel is.

&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Jaw breakers use an eccentric shaft to make the jaw move an inch and a half,at around 400 rpm.That makes 1500 engine rpm with a 540 rpm PTO.So i dont know if it will be direct drive with just a torsion damper to get maximum fuel efficiency,or with a 1:1.25 reduction so the tractor engine can run at 1900 to 2000 rpm to get more power.CrushersThe jaw dies must be replaced regularly due to wear.Figure 8.1 shows two basic types of jaw crushers: single toggle and double toggle.In the single toggle jaw crusher,an eccentric shaft is installed on the top of the crusher.Shaft rotation causes,along with.
