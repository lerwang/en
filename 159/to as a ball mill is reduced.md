## The operating principle of the ball mill
The operating principle of the ball mill consists of following steps.In a continuously operating ball mill,feed material fed through the central hole one of the caps into the drum and moves therealong,being exposed by grinding media.The material grinding occurs during impact falling grindinMicronization of a Soft Material: Air Jet and Micro Ball.&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;A ball mill is also commonly employed for fine grinding.In a ball mill,grinding energy is transferred to materials through media such as balls,rods,pebbles,by moving the mill body.For both types of mills the mechanisms by which particle size is reduced follow the same principles.
