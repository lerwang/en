18 12 2020&#0183;&#32;The simplified analytical formulas can be used to rapidly evaluate the collision force in ship collision accidents,but it is found that the existing simplified formulas are only applicable to bulb structures including small angle inclined elements and not suitable for large angle inclined elements which exist in ship bridge collisionWho invented the formula for Kinetic Energy (KE = 1 2 mv^2.But if structural damage is imparted in any form,it is the force reflected by kinetic energy,which grows quadratically to velocity,which will alter and divide shapes,and exert its strong influence on the motions of those objects that remain.The 1 2 in the kinetic energy formula was only added much later,in the early nineteenth century.
