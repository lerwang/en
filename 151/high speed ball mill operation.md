## Speeds and feeds
Cutting speed may be defined as the rate at the workpiece surface,irrespective of the machining operation used.A cutting speed for mild steel of 100 ft min is the same whether it is the speed of the cutter passing over the workpiece,such as in a turning operation,or the speed of the cutter moving past a workpiece,sBall MillThe High Energy Ball Mill E max and MM 500 were developed for grinding with the highest energy input.The innovative design of both,the mills and the grinding jars,allows for continuous grinding down to the nano range in the shortest amount of time with only minor warming effects.These ball mills are also suitable for mechano chemistry.

## Ball Mill
For ball milling,there is an optimum speed where the centrifugal force at the top of the mill is just balanced by the force of gravity.This caused the balls to be lifted to the maximum height before they fall onto the balls below,thus imparting the most kinetic energy.In practice,the ball mill is run at just belowThe operating principle of the ball millThe operating principle of the ball mill consists of following steps.In a continuously operating ball mill,feed material fed through the central hole one of the caps into the drum and moves therealong,being exposed by grinding media.The material grinding occurs during impact falling grindin

## The operating principle of the ball mill
The operating principle of the ball mill consists of following steps.In a continuously operating ball mill,feed material fed through the central hole one of the caps into the drum and moves therealong,being exposed by grinding media.The material grinding occurs during impact falling grinding balls and abrasion the particles between the balls.High speed B design bearingsB design bearings are designed for high speed operation and are best suited for lighter loads and lower operating temperatures.When compared to E and D design bearings,B design bearings are equipped with the maximum number of very small balls.The smaller,lighter balls reduce the centrifugal loads acting on the outer ring raceway and therefore reduce the
