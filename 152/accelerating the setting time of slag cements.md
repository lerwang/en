## US5340385A Hydraulic cement set accelerating admixtures,
New set accelerating admixtures for hydraulic cement compositions are disclosed These admixtures incorporate known set accelerators and certain low molecular weight glycols,eg,glycerol and ethylene glycol,are found to be surprisingly effective in decreasing the initial set time of hydraulic cements,mortars,and concretes,and are advantageous as reduced temperature set acceleratorsConcrete Time Of Set Slag CementHow Does Slag Cement Affect Time of Set? At temperatures less than 85 degrees Fahrenheit,concrete containing slag cement can have longer times of set,when compared with 100 percent portland cement concrete The lower the ambient and or concrete temperatures,the slower the set,
