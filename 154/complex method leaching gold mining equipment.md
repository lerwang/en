## Cyanide Process
The gold is mixed with the sodium cyanide which leads to the following Elsener’s equation and reaction.This is done to make soluble gold Now the gold is soluble.This method of making soluble gold is known as leaching.In the process of leaching,a dilute formGold Recovery,Processing Gold,Gold LeachingGold heap leaching process is a method in which a leaching solution is sprayed with a spray leaching system to selectively leach gold in the ore and recover gold from the pregnant liquid flowing out of the heap during the infiltration process.

## Gold CIL &amp; CIP Gold Leaching Process Explained CCD
At many operating gold plants,an increase in gold dissolution is observed when a leach slurry is transferred from one type of process equipment to another (i.e.between leach tanks,thickeners,filters,pumps,and pipelines).This is explained by the different mixing.Leaching &amp; Adsorption Resource BookAfter the leaching process is complete,the soluble gold must be concentrated and separated from the process slurry.The method of recovery of gold from the process slurry is by carbon adsorption.Adsorption is a term used to describe the attraction of a mineral
