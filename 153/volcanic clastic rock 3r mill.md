## Geology of Alberta
The geology of Alberta encompasses parts of the Canadian Rockies and thick sedimentary sequences,bearing coal,oil and natural gas,atop complex Precambrian crystalline basement rock.Geologic History,Stratigraphy &amp; Tectonics The Precambrian granite and gneiss crystalline basement rocks beneath Alberta are extremely ancient,dating to the Archean and Proterozoic.ReservoirReservoir Porosity Porosity is the void space in a rock that can store the fluids.It is measured as either a volume percentage or a fraction (expressed as a decimal).In the subsurface this volume may be filled with petroleum (oil and gas),water,a range of non

## Petrology
These sediments and rocks lie on the border between the igneous and sedimentary realms.For this reason,they are commonly ignored in traditional igneous petrology and sedimentology courses and textbooks.Volcaniclastic refers to all clastic sediments composed mainly of particles of volcanic origin,regardless of how the sediment formed.ReservoirReservoir Porosity.Porosity is the void space in a rock that can store the fluids.It is measured as either a volume percentage or a fraction (expressed as a decimal).In the subsurface this volume may be filled with petroleum (oil and gas),water,a range of non hydrocarbon gasses (CO2,H2S,N2),or some combination of these.

## Volcanic breccia.Clastic texture = pyroclastic or volcano.
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Volcanic breccias are clastic textured,extrusive igneous rocks.They generally appear as multicolored masses of jumbled angular grains.Volcanic breccias have violent origins.They form from explosive volcanic eruptions (cf.effusive eruptions lava flow eruptions).Volcanoes having felsic or intermediate chemistries typically erupt violently.Volcanic and Extrusive Igneous RocksRhyolite is a high silica rock,the extrusive counterpart of granite.It is typically banded and,unlike this specimen,full of large crystals (phenocrysts).Red volcanic rocks are usually altered from their original black by superheated steam.
