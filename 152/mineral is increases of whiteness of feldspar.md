## CALCITE IN PAPER
In the paper sector,micronized calcite has been used in paper and cardboard production by adding it into cellulose in different proportions.Since calcite increases the whiteness of paper,naturally grinded calcite is preferred where costs of making pulp are high since it diminishes the requirement of additional whitening pigments.This also makes the process more eco friendly.FeldsparIt was originally proposed that as the altered layer increases in thickness,the rate of dissolution decreases until a steady state rate is achieved.This diffusional rate control is now generally thought to be incorrect as feldspar dissolution rates generally increase with decreasing pH,which in turn results in a thicker leached layer [94].
