## Cement Types
What are the differences in these cement types and how are they tested,produced,and identified in practice? In the most general sense,portland cement is produced by heating sources of lime,iron,silica,and alumina to clinkering temperature (2,500 to 2,800 degrees Fahrenheit) in a rotating kiln,then grinding the clinker to a fine powder.Types of Portland Cement: 4 Types Concrete …19&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The types are: 1.Portland Pozzolana Cement (IS 1991) 2.Fly Ash 3.White Cement 4.Coloured Cements.Type # 1.Portland Pozzolana Cement (IS 1991): An inter ground or blended mixture of Portland cement and pozzolana is called Portland pozzolana cement.This cement can be manufactured either by intimately inter grinding Portland.
