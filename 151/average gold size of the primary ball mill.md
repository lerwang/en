## Ball mill
A ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind,blend and sometimes for mixing of materials for use in mineral dressing processes,paints,pyrotechnics,ceramics and selective laser sintering.It works on the principle of impact and attrition: size reduction is done by impact as the balls drop from near the top of the shell.A ball mill consists of a hollow cylindrical shell rotatiBall MillsThe ball mill is a tumbling mill that uses steel balls as the grinding media.The length of the cylindrical shell is usually 1 1.5 times the shell diameter (Figure 8.11).The feed can be dry,with less than 3% moisture to minimize ball coating,or slurry containing 20 40% water by weight.

## Ball Mills
Although rod mill installations are thus restricted in normal practice to the coarse crushing of soft and friable ores,it is sometimes found that the most economical method of grinding an ore of not more than average hardness is to use a rod mill in the primary and a ball mill in the secondary stage.B2GoldHeadquartered in Vancouver,Canada,B2Gold Corp.is the world's new senior gold producer.Founded in 2007,today,B2Gold has five operating gold mines and numerous exploration and development projects in various countries including Nicaragua,the Philippines,Namibia,Mali,Burkina Faso,Colombia and Finland.With the large,low cost Fekola Mine now in production,B2Gold is well positioned in.

## Mill (grinding)
SAG is an acronym for semi autogenous grinding.SAG mills are autogenous mills that also use grinding balls like a ball mill.A SAG mill is usually a primary or first stage grinder.SAG mills use a ball charge of 8 to 21%.The largest SAG mill is 42' (12.8m) in diameter,powered by a 28 MW (38,000 HP) motor.(PDF) A comparison of wear rates of ball mill grinding mediaA comparison of wear rates of ball mill grinding media.pdf Journal of Mining and Metallurgy,52 A (1) (2016 ) 1 10 # Corresponding author : alex.jankovic@metso.com
