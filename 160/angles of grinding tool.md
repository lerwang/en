## Grinding Lathe Tools on a Belt Sander Part 2.
The tool we will grind as an example below is one of these general purpose tools and the tool angles used are typical for a tool that has to cut multiple materials under varying conditions.These tool angles are a compromise,just as the shape of a general purpose tool is a compromise but they work fairly well.GRINDING TAPERS AND ANGLES Tool and die making2020 2 16&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Grinding angles with a dressed grinding wheel Where a wheel of the appropriate face shape is available,an angle may be ground with the axis of the workpiece aligned with the wheel spindle.In some cases it may be economical to dress a wheel to the required angle.(Fig.6) (Follow the general grinding …

## Diamond CBN Clearance Angle Grinding Wheel for …
24&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Description: By grinding clearance angles and tool flanks on a tool cutter,you reduce the contact area between the tool and the workpiece later on during the drilling or milling process.The clearance angles on the face and circumferential surface of a tool are referred to as the axial and radial clearance angles.The many angles of centerless grindingThe many angles of centerless grinding.To get that roundness the angles that the wheels contact the part are critical.The grinding wheel and regulating wheel must also be dressed—having the part’s desired profile cut into them with a stationary diamond or diamond wheel (this process is done on the machine and takes some time).
