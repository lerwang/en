## Our Mining Process
IOC's production process begins in the mine with drilling and blasting.The crude ore is loaded into trucks,which dump the material into the loading pockets or into the in pit crusher located in the Luce pit.How iron is madeIn this work,we analyzed the bioleaching process of an ore concentrate,using SEM,XRD and rheometry.Impurities,such as zinc,were dissolved (about 50%) in 1 day.Bioleaching dissolved other impurities and increased the iron purity,with maximum reached at day 5.

## Iron Mining Process
Iron Mining Process.From blasting to crushing to separation more than 85% of the iron mined in the United States is mined in northeastern Minnesota to make our nation’s steel.Blasting Taconite is a very hard rock.Using explosives,the taconite is blasted into small pieces.The iron ore is separated from the taconite using magnetism.Iron ProductionIron ore is usually a mixture of iron and vast quantities of impurities such as sand and clay referred to as gangue.The iron found in iron ores are found in the form of iron oxides.As a result of these impurities,iron must be first separated from the gangue and then converted to pure iron.

## Processes and Procedures in the Extraction of Iron.
The extraction of iron from its ores is quite a technical process.The iron ore is first roasted in air to produce iron(III) oxide which is mixed with coke and limestone and then further heated to a very high temperature in a blast furnace.These materials are loaded into the blast furnace from the top while a blast of hot air is introduced into it from beneath via small pipes known as tuyeres.Iron Geoscience Australia5&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The process continued for nearly a billion years and eventually let to the accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere.Resources.Most of the world's important iron ore resources occur in banded iron formations,which are almost exclusively of Precambrian age (i.e.greater than 541 million years old).BIFs occur on all continents.

## How does the iron ore beneficiation process work?
At its basic level,iron ore beneficiation consists of the following steps: 1.Crush and grind to a sufficiently fine size that the iron oxide minerals are broken free of the gangue minerals like silica (Liberation) 2.Physically sort the mineral.Different Types of Iron Ore4&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The iron minerals that are at present used as ores are hematite,magnetite,limonite,and siderite; also,occasionally ankerite,goethite,and turgite.Hematite is the most important iron ore.The iron content of the pure minerals is as follows: Ankerite is a carbonate of lime,magnesia,manganese,and iron.It is of valuable composition.
