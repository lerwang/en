## Types of Graphite: Amorphous,Flake and Vein ,
Vein graphite is believed to originate from crude oil deposits that through time,temperature and pressure were converted to graphite Riddle said that the veins “are extremely small and range.What Gems Are Found in Igneous Rock? Geology InIgneous rocks are formed and created by magmatic processes in the earth To form very large crystals of rare minerals,exceptional conditions are needed For instance,a rock called pegmatite is formed by the crystallization of magma enriched with water in the veins of other rocks,and may contain.

## Graphite and gold on the northeast schist margin,…
29&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Gold and graphite are closely associated in many gold deposits around the world,and the graphite is commonly thought to have played a role in causing the gold to deposit in the rocks.Hence,rocks rich in graphite are potential targets for gold exploration,especially in schist belts such as Otago.Vein graphite deposits: geological settings,origin,and.&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Graphite deposits result from the metamorphism of sedimentary rocks rich in carbonaceous matter or from precipitation from carbon bearing fluids (or melts).The latter process forms vein deposits which are structurally controlled and usually occur in granulites or igneous rocks.The origin of carbon,the mechanisms of transport,and the factors controlling graphite deposition are discussed in.

## Abiotic carbon and the formation of graphite deposits.
The release and deposition of carbon from carbonate minerals consists of the reaction: carbonate mineral + hydrogen &gt; (methane to butane) + water + metal oxide or hydroxide.These reactions proceed under conditions that are geologically reasonable and provide a mechanism for the formation of graphite vein …Saint Jean Carbon Walker Graphite Lump Vein ProjectWalker graphite property is a past graphite producer with about 816 tons of lump graphite extracted from the mine between 1876 and 1920 The fifth test provided the 991%Cg best result
