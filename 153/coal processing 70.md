## Metallurgical coal BHP
Metallurgical coal is a primary ingredient in the steel making process It takes around 770 kilograms of coal to make one ton of steel Approximately 70% of global steel is produced in basic oxygen blast furnac The majority of steel is used in: Construction: like buildings,bridges and infrastructure Transport: like ships,planes and trainsCoalCoal is a hard rock which can be burned as a solid fossil fuel.It is mostly carbon but also contains hydrogen,sulphur,oxygen and nitrogen.It is a sedimentary rock formed from peat,by the pressure of rocks laid down later on top.Peat,and therefore coal,is formed from the remains of plants which lived millions of years ago in tropical.
