## Pulp and Paper Industry Odors Wisconsin Department of.
Background In some Wisconsin areas,the pulp and paper industry is known for its distinctive smell.One type of odor comes from a special technique called kraft pulping which uses heat and chemicals to pulp wood chips for making paper.This reaction produces gaseous sulfur compounds called &quot;total reduced sulfur&quot; or TRS gases.The odor associated with TRS gases is typically described as.RECOVERY AND RECYCLING OF SO2 IN A SULFITE PULP MILLRECOVERY AND RECYCLING OF SO2 IN A SULFITE PULP MILL Leo E.Hakka Cansolv Technologies Inc.8475 ave.Christophe Colomb,Suite 2000,Montreal,Quebec H2M 2N9 Canada + 4411 www.cansolv.com David J.Brown Simon Carves

## Sulfonation and Sulfation Processes
Sulfur trioxide (SO3) reacts with an organic molecule in this case an alkyl benzene to form a sulfur carbon bond.One of the characteristics of this process is that the resultant alkyl benzene sulfonic acid is a stable molecule.Figure 1.Sulfonation SO3 + (CH2) 11Control of sulfidity in a modern kraft pulp millIf the sulfur purge flow contains sodium,the purge in many cases causes increased sodium consumption in the mill,either as sodium hydroxide or sodium carbonate.This paper discusses the contributions
