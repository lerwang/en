## Pegmatite
A pegmatite is an igneous rock,formed underground,with interlocking crystals usually larger than 2.5 cm in size (1 in).Most pegmatites are found in sheets of rock (dikes and veins) near large masses of igneous rocks called batholiths.[1] The word pegmatite derives from Homeric Greek,πήγνυμι (pegnymi),which means “to bind together.
