## End mill
An end mill is a type of milling cutter,a cutting tool used in industrial milling applications.It is distinguished from the drill bit in its application,geometry,and manufacture.While a drill bit can only cut in the axial direction,a milling bit can generally cut in all directions,though some cannot cut axially.End mills are used in.(PDF) Investigation of lead and tilt angle effects in axis …In five axis ball end machining,stability of the milling process is not only determined by the combination of depth of cut and the spindle speed,but also determined by the lead and tilt angles.
