## The Effect of Ball Size Diameter on Milling Performance
The Effect of Ball Size Diameter on Milling PerformanceBall MillThe ball mill is a tumbling mill that uses steel balls as the grinding media.The length of the cylindrical shell is usually 1 1.5 times the shell diameter (Figure 8.11).The feed can be dry,with less than 3% moisture to minimize ball coating,or slurry containing 20 40% water by weight.

and with the decreased grain size,the necessary ball size also decreases (Olejnik,2010; 2011).For each grain size there is an optimal ball size (Trumic et.al.2007).The bigger ball in relation to the optimal one will have an excess energy,and consequently,the smaller ball millHow Can I calculate new ball size and weight desing for.&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Re: How Can I calculate new ball size and weight desing for ball mill.Hi,We have a similar mill.Pregrinding with hammer crusher and mono chamber mill.Thisis what a proposed based on literture review i did and others agree its more and less correc
