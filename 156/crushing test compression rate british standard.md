## Glass Standards and Ceramic Standards ASTM International
ASTM standards for glass and ceramic standards define how to evaluate the properties of glass products and ceramic products.Standard Test Method for Measurement of Viscosity of Glass Between 10 4 Pa·s and 10 8 Pa·s by Viscous Compression of a Solid Right Cylinder.Standard Test Method for Filtration Rate of Ceramic Whiteware Clays:.Compressive strength WikipediaThe compressive strength of the material would correspond to the stress at the red point shown on the curve.In a compression test,there is a linear region where the material follows Hooke's law.Hence,for this region,=,where,this time,E refers to the Young's Modulus for compression.In this region,the material deforms elastically and returns to its original length when the stress is removed.
