## An Assessment of Laboratory Leaching Tests
An Assessment of Laboratory Leaching Tests for Predicting the Impacts of Fill Material on Ground Water and Surface Water Quality A Report to the Legislature December 2003 Publication No.107 printed on recycled paperNew Applications of Diagnostic LeachingAbstract Diagnostic leaching tests provide a good indication of gold deportation in its various occurrence phases.With the results of these tests,possible flowsheets for difficult ore treatment can be established for further evaluation and plant operation can be optimized.

## Diagnostic Leaching for Refractory Gold Ores
A diagnostic leach test can be very useful to qualitatively assess how gold occurs within the ore and the extent to which it may be refractory.Several different permutations of diagnostic leach tests depend on specific objectives,but they generally involve the.Diagnostic Leach TestIf gold is coarse grained or if it occurs as slow leaching minerals like gold tellurides,it may not be effectively recovered in the cyanidation after diagnostic leaching.There are many reasons.

## Gold Diagnostic Leach Test
By understanding the nature of gold deportment with a Gold Diagnostic Leach the likely processing method can be gained early on in flowsheet development.The test can also be applied to process feed streams to troubleshoot reasons for low gold recoveries in an operating environment.The test works by selectively leaching gold carrier minerals one.Column Leach TestingColumn leach testing is typically performed once your ores amenability to heap leaching has initially been confirmed using the cheaper and faster coarse ore bottle roll test method.Grinding Solutions offers column leach test programmes which can be used to investigate factors including crush size,agglomeration conditions,cyanide dosage,and solution application rate.
