## Introduction to Cement Plants Harmonic Cancellation Power
shaft kiln plants employ dry grinding but nodulises the powder before feeding the kiln by spraying water in a drum noduliser.Hence the process used in VSK is semidry process.5.Kiln Employed.Portland cement was first produced in a vertical brick kiln and cement was produced exclusively in vertical shaft kilns in the&nbspReplacing Vertical Shaft Kilns Industrial Efficiency TechnologyFor vertical shaft kilns (VSK),which are commonly used in China,switching over to a new and more efficient suspension preheater precalciner kiln system offers Cost Saving Opportunities for Cement Making,discusses energy efficiency practices and technologies that can be implemented in cement manufacturing plants.

## Vertical Shaft Kilns (VSK) vs.Rotary Kilns SIME Ing.
There are two main types of kilns to produce cement: the Vertical Shaft Kiln and the Rotary Kiln.The Vertical Shaft Kiln or VSK is probably the first type of kiln that was used and it can be traced back to the 5th century A.C.in Greece,when they were used for limestone calcining (Reiter,AC,11 1997,p.23).In the 20th century,&nbspShaft Kiln,Vertical Shaft Kiln,Vertical Kiln Cement.Shaft kiln,also known as vertical kiln,vertical shaft kiln,is a vertical and fixed clinker firing equipment.The raw meal ball with coal is fed into cement kiln from the kiln crown,and raw meal ball moves from top to bottom,air move from bottom to top.In fact,the physical and chemical changes of shaft kiln are similar to that of cement rotary kiln.
