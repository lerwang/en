## 7 Reasons to Love Polyhalite The World's Only Polyhalite,
We reached the polyhalite seam over 1,000m under the Earth’s surface in 2010 and have been mining it ever since,becoming the world’s first and only polyhalite mine As a fertilizer,polyhalite,marketed as Polysulphate™,enhances plant growth and strength,increases yields and improves product quality There are many reasons to love polyhalite Here’s seven,Ore mineralsCesium The major ore mineral is pollucite,a pegmatite mineral Production and use of this metal is extremely small (a few thousand kilograms per year) Chlorine Produced from the mineral halite (rock salt) Chromium The chief source is the mineral chromite which is found in large layered intrusives and serpentine bodi

## Polyhalite Wikipedia
Despite the similarity in names between halite (the naturally occurring form of table salt) and it,their only connection is that both are evaporite minerals The use of the Greek words for many and salt in polyhalite is due to polyhalite consisting of several metals that can form salts in the more general sense of the word salt used in chemistryPotash Flotation ProcessPotash Flotation The conditioner and reagentized salt brine slurry is floated in a “Sub A” Flotation Machine.In the circuit shown,roughing is accomplished in a “Sub A” Free Flow Flotation Machine with no intermediate weirs or feed pipes.This allows the coarse

## What Are the Uses of Magnetite? Reference
Ferric chloride and ferric sulphate are manufactured with magnetite as one of the starting materials These chemicals are effective in clarifying raw water in water purification plants The dark,glossy nature of magnetite ore has led to its use in landscaping as accent rocksSalt Halite Minerals Eduion CoalitionMany rock salt mines use the roomandpillar method of underground mining in which the resource is extracted,leaving 'pillars' of the material untouched,which creates 'rooms.' Solution Mining: Solution mining involves injecting a solvent to dissolve and recover underground soluble salt minerals.
