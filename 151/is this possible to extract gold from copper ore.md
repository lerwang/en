&quot;To extract three grams of gold from ore,you need one tonne of rock.We are not yet viable on a big scale like that,&quot; he said,adding that to that end they are currently searching for industry.How to Use Bleach on Gold Ore to Remove Gold …Gold is an almost non reactive metal,but halogens — chlorine,bromine,fluorine and iodine — can dissolve it.Chlorine is the cheapest and lightest product that can achieve this.Bleach is the chemical compound sodium hypochlorite.When combined with hydrochloric acid,the mixture produces chlorine that dissolves gold from gold ore.

## Copper Smelting Process
1&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Modern copper smelters use processed copper ore fed into a flash furnace,typically fired by oxygen which produces blister copper,being further processed in a converter furnace.Molten copper is poured from here into rectangular moulds,the resulting ingots subjected to electrolysis producing a metal of 99.9% purity.Copper can be recycled indefinitely without the base metal being compromised.How can metal mining impact the environment? …2 &ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Material adapted from: Hudson,T.L,Fox,F.D.and Plumlee,G.S.1999.Metal Mining and the Environment,p.7,27,35,39.Published by the American Geosciences Institute Environmental Awareness Series.Modern mining operations actively strive to mitigate potential environmental consequences of extracting metals,and such operations are strictly regulated in the United
