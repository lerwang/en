## Calcium carbonate
Calcium carbonate (limestone) is heated to form calcium oxide (quicklime) and carbon dioxide: It is an endothermic reaction and the equilibrium lies far to the left at low temperatures.Only at about 1200 K does the partial pressure of carbon dioxide exceed atmospheric pressure and the decomposition proceeds to completion.Abra Mining and Industrial Corporation,Philippines,Henceforth,management decided unanimously that the manufacture of other products from the limestone materials,such as Ground Calcium Carbonate (GCC),Precipitated Calcium Carbonate (PCC) and Hydrated Lime,be given utmost priority
