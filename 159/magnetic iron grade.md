## Notes on Magnetic Induction and Demagnetization …
Magnetic Induction.Magnetic induction is the process by which substances like iron are magnetised by the magnetic field.The magnet causes the individual particles of the iron,which act like tiny magnets,to line up so that the sample as a whole becomes magnetised.Black Iron Oxide Magnetite (Fe3O4) Powder1&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Magnetite is a natural iron oxide magnet,hence the name,giving it a very nice distinguishing characteristic.Magnetite is the most magnetic of all the minerals on Earth.Magnetite is a member of the spinel group which has the standard formula A(B)2O4.The A and B represent different metal ions that occupy specific sites in the crystal structure.

Therefore the plastic ball is not magnetic and has no magnetic field.In some materials (e.g.iron),called ferromagnetic materials,there are regions called domains,where the electrons' magnetic fields line up with each other.All the atoms in each domain are grouped together so that the magnetic fields from their electrons point the same way.Magnetic MaterialsMagnets are ideal for separating steel from aluminum because they only pick up iron or nickel based substances.While magnetic fields affect all substances to a small degree,the nature of iron and nickel make these metals strongly responsive to outside magnetic fields.Aluminum and most other metals do not respond as such.
