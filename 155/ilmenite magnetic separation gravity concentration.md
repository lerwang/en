## Mineral processing
Mineral processing Mineral processing Concentration: Concentration involves the separation of valuable minerals from the other raw materials received from the grinding mill.In large scale operations this is accomplished by taking advantage of the different properties of the minerals to be separated.These properties can be colour (optical sorting),density (gravity separation),magnetic.RutileNatural rutile may contain up to 10% iron and significant amounts of niobium and tantalum.In large enough quantities in beach sands,rutile forms an important constituent of heavy minerals and ore deposits.Miners extract and separate the valuable minerals‚Äîe.g.
