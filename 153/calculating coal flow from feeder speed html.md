NOTE 2 In some countries,the reference wind speed is taken as equal to the meteo data available for the site.If not,an appropriate method to extrapolate from the meteo wind speed to the reference wind speed at site has to be used (see annex A).3.10Conveyor CapacityConveyor capacity is determined by the belt speed,width and the angle of the belt and can be expressed as Q = ρ A v (1) where Q = conveyor capacity (kg s,lb s) ρ = density of transported material (kg m 3,lb ft 3) A = cross sectional.
