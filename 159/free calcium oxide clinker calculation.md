：16 ANN and MATLAB calculation tool were firstly utilized in the field of the forecast of the content of free Calcium Oxide in the calcinations clinker in Rotary Kiln and the quality of clinker.Features of formation of the phase composition and2019630&ensp&#0183&enspThe fact of possible decomposition of anhydrite at a given temperature and volatilization of its degradation products,which is also characterized by a decrease in the intensity of the analytical lines CaS[O.sub.4],not mounted,because the clinker out Ca[O.sub.fr] free calcium oxide released by the decay of CaS[O.sub.4].

## Portland cement clinker,cement based and a method …
Analysis of free calcium oxide shows that in the samples of clinker according to the invention the content of Fe 2 ABOUT 3 is 28,5 wt.when the total content of Cao in clinker 18% and there is a link with a linear correlation coefficient of about 0,78 between the increase in the content of iron oxide in the free calcium oxide and decreasing.What is the chemical composition of cement and their.The quality of the cement determines the quality of the clinker.The quality clinker should have the appropriate mineral composition and rock structure.Therefore,the control of the chemical composition of clinker is one of the central aspects of.
