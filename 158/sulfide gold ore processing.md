## Gold flotation process
Flotation is a method that is widely used in gold ore processing plant to process the rock gold,commonly used in dealing with highly floatable sulfide minerals containing gold ore.Flotation process can maximum enrich gold to the sulfide mineral,tailings can be abandoned directly,the cost of processing plant is low,80% of China's rock gold are used in this method.ALACER GOLD TO PURSUE POX AS SULFIDE ORE PROCESSING …Page 1 of 7 ALACER GOLD TO PURSUE POX AS SULFIDE ORE PROCESSING METHOD Novem,Toronto: Alacer Gold Corp.(“Alacer” or the “Corporation”) [TSX: ASR and ASX: AQG] is pleased to announce its intention to pursue whole ore.

## Copper Mining and Processing: Processing of Copper …
Copper processing is a complicated process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper called cathodes,which will ultimately be made into products for everyday use.The most common types of ore,copper oxide and copper sulfide,undergo two different processes,hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy,respectively,due to the different.SulfideSulfide (British English also sulphide)[2] is an inorganic anion of sulfur with the chemical formula S2− or a compound containing one or more S2− ions.Solutions of sulfide salts are corrosive.Sulfide also refers to chemical compounds large families of inorganic and organic compounds,e.g.lead sulfide and dimethyl sulfide.Hydrogen.
