## Grinding wheel : Wikis (The Full Wiki)
A less dense wheel is able to take a deeper or wider cut with less coolant,as the chip clearance on the wheel is greater.The grade of the wheel determines how tightly the bond holds the abrasive.Grade affects almost all considerations of grinding,such as wheel speed,coolant flow,maximum and minimum feed rates,and grinding depth.Vitrified wheel grinding wheelOther articles where Vitrified wheel is discussed: abrasive: Forming and firing: The so called vitrified wheel is fired in high temperature kilns at temperatures of 1,260&#176; C (2,300&#176; F).Electric ,oil ,and gas fired kilns are used.The length of the “burn” varies with wheel size and can be as long as two weeks.
