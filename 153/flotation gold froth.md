## 1 Froth Flotation Fundamental Principles
1 1 Froth Flotation Fundamental Principles Froth flotation is a highly versatile method for physically separating particles based on differences in the ability of air bubbles to selectively adhere to specific mineral surfaces in a mineral water slurry.The particles withIntroduction to Mineral Processing2020 2 24&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Gold,silver,copper,lead,zinc,molybdenum,iron,potash,phosphate,and even sand for glass are often processed by froth flotation.Without froth flotation,many of the metals and minerals used every day in our modern world would be much more expensive.Solvent Extraction Solvent extraction is a hydrometallurgical process.The process entails:
