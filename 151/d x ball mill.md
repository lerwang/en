## Ball Mills
Ball Mills are generally used to grind material 1 4 inch and finer,down to the particle size of 20 to 75 microns.To achieve a reasonable efficiency with ball mills,they must be operated in a closed system,with oversize material continuously being recirculated back into the mill to be reduced.Ball milling in organic synthesis: solutions and.During the last decade numerous protocols have been published using the method of ball milling for synthesis all over the field of organic chemistry.However,compared to other methods leaving their marks on the road to sustainable synthesis (e.g.microwave,ultrasound,ionic liquids) chemistry in ball mills
