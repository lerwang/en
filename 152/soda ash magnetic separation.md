## Water leaching of boron from soda ash activated …
Water leaching of boron from ludwigite ore activated by soda ash under reductive,natural and oxidative atmospheres was investigated by evaluating the effects of roasting parameters (roasting atmosphere,temperature and time) and leaching parameters (leaching temperature,leaching time,liquid to solid mass ratio and feed particle size) on boron leaching.Magnetic separation process for trona6&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The magnetic separation step is accomplished by a rare earth magnetic separation method.With regard to the beneficiation of trona,typical impurities can be removed during the magnetic separation step include shale,which has a higher magnetic susceptibility than trona.
