## Lightweight concrete
Concrete is considered to be lightweight is the density is not more than 2200kg m 3 (the density of normal weight concrete is assumed to be between 2300kg m 3 and 2400kg m 3) and a proportion of the aggregate should have a density of less than 2000kg m 3 Lightweight concrete can be specified using the notation LC for the strength class,eg.What is Lightweight Concrete? Types,Uses and AdvantagesLightweight concrete mixture is made with a lightweight coarse aggregate and sometimes a portion or entire fine aggregates may be lightweight instead of normal aggregates.Structural lightweight concrete has an in place density (unit weight) on the order of 90 to 115 lb ft&#179; (1440 to 1840 kg m&#179;).
