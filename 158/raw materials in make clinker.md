## Cement clinker
Cement clinker is a solid material produced in the manufacture of Portland cement as an intermediary product.Clinker occurs as lumps or nodules,usually 3 millimetres (0.12 in) to 25 millimetres (0.98 in) in diameter.It is produced by sintering (fusing together without melting to the point of liquefaction) limestone and aluminosilicate materials such as clay during the cement kiln stage.RawmillA raw mill is the equipment used to grind raw materials into &quot;rawmix&quot; during the manufacture of cement.Rawmix is then fed to a cement kiln,which transforms it into clinker,which is then ground to make cement in the cement mill.The raw milling stage of the process effectively defines the chemistry (and therefore physical properties) of the.

## Clinker quality depends on raw material composition.
Portland cement is the most common type of cement in the world.It is used primarily to make concrete,mortar,and grout.Portland cement manufacturing begins with mining and then grinding raw materials that include limestone and clay,to a fine powder,called raw meal,which is then heated to a sintering temperature as high as 1450 C in a cement kiln.Use of raw materials in the cement industryIn 2018,the German cement industry procured around 43 million tonnes of primary raw materials ().Furthermore,approx.8 million tonnes of alternative raw materials were used to manufacture approx.34.0 million tonnes of cement.
