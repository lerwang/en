## Introduction to Coal: Uses of Coal,Formation of Coal,
Coal is a black sedimentary rock It usually occurs in coal beds found in coal min Coal comprises of carbon,hydrogen,oxygen,sulphur,etc When dead plants and animals decay and convert into peat which in turn is converted into lignite,then sub bituminous coal,after that bituminous coal,and lastly anthracite Hence,coal is a fossil fuel(DOC) Thermal Power Plant Project report Niraj Mani,Globally,fossil fueled thermal power plants produce a large part of man made CO2 emissions to the atmosphere,and efforts to reduce these are varied and widespread Almost all coal,nuclear,geothermal,solar thermal electric,and waste incineration plants,as well as many natural gas power plants are thermal
