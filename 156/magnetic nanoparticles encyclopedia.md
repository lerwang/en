## Nanoparticle
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Nanoparticles in the environment Nanoparticles occur naturally in the environment in large volumes.For example,the sea emits an aerosol of salt that ends up floating around in the atmosphere in a range of sizes,from a few nanometres upward,and smoke from volcanoes and fires contains a huge variety of nanoparticles,many of which could be classified as dangerous to human health.Nanoparticles as drug delivery systemsals,and magnetic nanoparticles are the examples of nanocarriers that have been tested as drug delivery systems (Fig.1).The way of conjugating the drug to the nanocarrier and the strategy of its targeting is highly important for a targeted therapy.A drug may be
