## Induction Melting System
An Induction melting furnace uses a copper induction heating coil that delivers an alternating magnetic current to the metal within the coil.This alternating magnetic current creates a resistance in the metal,causing it to heat and eventually to melt.Chapter 6 Copper Production TechnologyThe Egyptian copper smelting furnace was filled with a mixture of copper ore,charcoal and iron ore to act as a flux It was blown for several hours by foot or hand bellows By the end of the smelt the copper had separated from the slag,which was tapped off SOURCE Robert Raymond,Out of tfre Fjery Furnace (University Park,PA The Pennsylvania.

## Final Activity Report
a) Medium scale rotary furnace (Thermal Technology TL 1100) for thermochemical experiments at BAM b) Operation of the medium scale rotary furnace (view into the hot rotary tube from the outlet) Figure 4.ASH DEC pilot plant a) Storage,mixing and pelletingRecovery of cobalt from slag in a DC arc furnace at,The large scale testwork was set up in such a way that it would mimic the mode of operation of the industrial scale furnace Approximately 10% more Fe reduction was required in the large scale testwork to achieve Co recoveries similar to those achieved in the medium scale tests
