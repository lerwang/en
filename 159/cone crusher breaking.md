## Cone Crusher
The breaking head gyrates inside an inverted truncated cone.These crushers are designed so that the head to depth ratio is larger than the standard gyratory crusher and the cone angles are much flatter and the slope of the mantle and the concaves are parallel to.CrusherA cone crusher is similar in operation to a gyratory crusher,with less steepness in the crushing chamber and more of a parallel zone between crushing zones.A cone crusher breaks rock by squeezing the rock between an eccentrically gyrating spindle,which is covered by a wear resistant mantle,and the enclosing concave hopper,covered by a manganese concave or a bowl liner.
