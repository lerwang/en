Rock crushers often spray water to control PM emissions.Particulate matter (PM) is a complex mixture of extremely small particles and liquid droplets.PM is made up of a number of components,including acids such as nitrates and sulfates,organic chemicals,metals,soil,and dust.Sources of particulate matter include construction sites.11.19.1 Sand And Gravel ProcessingEmissions from the production of sand and gravel consist primarily of particulate matter (PM) and particulate matter less than 10 micrometers (PM 10) in aerodynamic diameter,which are emitted by many operations at sand and gravel processing plants,such as conveying,screening,crushing,and storing operations.
