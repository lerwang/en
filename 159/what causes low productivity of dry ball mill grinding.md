## Ball Mills
The ball mill is a tumbling mill that uses steel balls as the grinding media.The length of the cylindrical shell is usually 1 1.5 times the shell diameter (Figure 8.11).The feed can be dry,with less than 3% moisture to minimize ball coating,or slurry containing 20 40% water by weight.Dry GrindingLet us consider by dry grinding 40 ton.h − 1 of ore in a ball mill that enters at 5 mm and exits at 200 μm.The apparent density of the ore is 1.5 and its energy index E i is equal to 15.We estimate that the diameter of the mill is less than 3.8 m.
