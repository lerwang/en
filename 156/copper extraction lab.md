## GCSE CHEMISTRY
2017 3 27&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Extraction of Metals.Extraction of Copper.Copper is sometimes found as native metal.Copper ores include copper(II) oxide and copper(II) sulfide.Copper(II) oxide can be reduced by reaction with carbon.Some copper ores may contain only small amounts of copper.These are called low grade ores and have less than 1% copper but they are still used because copper is so valuable.The Extraction of CopperCopper can be extracted from non sulfide ores by a different process involving three separate stages: Reaction of the ore (over quite a long time and on a huge scale) with a dilute acid such as dilute sulfuric acid to produce a very dilute copper(II) sulfate solution.Concentration of the copper(II) sulfate solution by solvent extraction.
