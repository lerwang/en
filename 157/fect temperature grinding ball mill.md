1&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;the reasons why the ball mill is still used despite its higher energy de mand.Newly installed grinding cir cuits for cement in Europe are often still ball mill systems.The ball mill may seem old fashioned,but even this tried and tested mill has not stopped evolving.Further developed machine parts,improved wear partsCryomillThe Autofill system avoids direct contact with LN 2 and makes cryogenic grinding very safe.Its versatility (cryogenic,wet and dry grinding at room temperature) makes the CryoMill the ideal grinder for quantities up to 20 ml.You may also be interested in the High Energy Ball Mill Emax,an entirely new type of mill for high energy input.The.
