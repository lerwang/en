## Introduction to Mineral Processing
Introduction to Mineral Processing Froth Flotation Froth flotation is considered to be the most widely used method for ore beneficiation.In ore beneficiation,flotation is a process in which valuable minerals are separated from worthless material or other valuable.US4687571AA process for the separation of phosphate minerals from a phosphate carbonate ore,by flotation,wherein a phenol polymer such as a resol or a novolak,which improves the yield and selectivity of the phosphate minerals with respect to the carbonate minerals,is.
