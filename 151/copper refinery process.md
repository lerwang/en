## Copper Mining and Processing: Processing of Copper …
Copper processing is a complicated process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper called cathodes,which will ultimately be made into products for everyday use.The most common types of ore,copper oxide and copper sulfide,undergo two different processes,hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy,respectively,due to the different.Copper Mining &amp; Extraction Process Flow Chart4&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Copper Mining &amp; Extraction Process Flow Chart.Previous Next.View Larger Image.This flowchart made of machinery icons explains or expresses in simple but clear terms the step of the Copper Mining and Copper Extraction Process.Starting from either open pit or underground mining and using a different relevant treatment method for oxide or.
