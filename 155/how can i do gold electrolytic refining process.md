## The Gold Smelting Process
Gold miners have to smelt their gold in order to remove impurities resulting in pure gold.Most large scale gold miners send their ore to smelters with large equipment for the smelting process.Small scale miners still can do their own smelting using specialized kilns.(PDF) ANODE SLIME GAINED DURING ELECTROLYTIC …The aim of this research is to get better understanding of the electrolytic refining process in order to yield the anode slime.Three types of secondary copper anodes are electro.
