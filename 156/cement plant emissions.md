## New approach suggests path to emissions free cement …
It’s well known that the production of cement — the world’s leading construction material — is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions,accounting for about 8 percent of all such releases.If cement production were a country,it would be the world’s third largestCement and CO2 EmissionsOne ton of portland cement produces a ton of CO2 emissions; can alternatives reduce that by 97 percent? This summer,if you’re thinking of mixing two parts of pozzalona with one part lime and water as a tropical drink to serve to your guests,it will surely make.
