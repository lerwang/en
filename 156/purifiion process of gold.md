## 9 Step Process for Discovering,Mining &amp; Refining Gold
Gold miners too take special care to make the impact of mining for gold as light as possible.Reclaiming land to its previous natural state is the final and perhaps most important step to ensuring the process of obtaining gold doesn’t result in permanent damageGold Refining ProcessGold,as it occurs in Nature,is never pure.Occasionally the amount of alloying metal is less than 1%,hut as a general rule it is greater; the commonest alloy,in fact,the invariable one,being composed of gold and silver.Sometimes traces of copper are present,but.
