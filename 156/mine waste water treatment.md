## Lecture 4: Mining waste
Several types of waste are generated in a mine,but three types stand out with the largest volume: waste rock,tailings and mine water.In some cases,the mine uses certain chemicals such as cyanide in the processing stage.These chemicals often account forWater treatment Mine ClosureThus,there is no single solution for water treatment in mining and a sound understanding of the hydrogeology and hydrodynamics of each mine is crucial also for water treatment.In addition,since the contaminant sources and the water quality are usually very different from those of urban or industrial areas,the conventional waste water treatment systems are often unsuitable for mine waters.
