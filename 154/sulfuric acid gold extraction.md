## Copper extraction
Copper extraction refers to the methods used to obtain copper from its ores.The conversion of copper consists of a series of physical and electrochemical processes.Methods have evolved and vary with country depending on the ore source,local environmental regulations,and other factors.As in all mining operations,the ore must usually be.Acid Vs Gold&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Acid Vs Gold FlinnScientific Loading.Unsubscribe from FlinnScientific?

## Heap leaching
This method is an acid heap leaching method like that of the copper method in that it utilises sulfuric acid instead of cyanide solution to dissolve the target minerals from crushed ore.The amount of sulfuric acid required is much higher than for copper ores,asCHLORIDE HYPOCHLORITE OXIDATION AND LEACHING OF REFRACTORY SULFIDE GOLD …centrate containing 20.451 g Mg gold was obtained.After 24 hours,direct cyanide leaching of the initial ore resulted in only 54.8% gold recovery.However,cyanidation after dissolving the ore sample in hydrochloric acid (HCl),sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4 3) and nitric 3

## In situ leach Wikipedia
In situ leach for uranium has expanded rapidly since the 1990s,and is now the predominant method for mining uranium,accounting for 45 percent of the uranium mined worldwide in 2012 [2] Solutions used to dissolve uranium ore are either acid ( sulfuric acid or less commonly nitric acid ) or carbonate ( sodium bicarbonate,ammonium,Acid leaching pretreatment on two stage roasting pyrite,The leaching rate of the gold was greatly improved compared to the non acid leaching residue which gold content was about 112 g t after non cyanide extraction Therefore,it is beneficial to remove the arsenic and iron from the pyrite cinder for the gold recovery
