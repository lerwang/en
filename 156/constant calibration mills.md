## Calibration
As an example,a manual process may be used for calibration of a pressure gauge.The procedure requires multiple steps,[citation needed] to connect the gauge under test to a reference master gauge and an adjustable pressure source,to apply fluid pressure to both reference and test gauges at definite points over the span of the gauge,and to compare the readings of the two.Assessing the performance of index calibration survey …Index calibration survey methods fundamentally rely on a predictable relationship between the index and the population size density,as well as a constant detection probability of the index across the range of variables potentially affecting it (Anderson,2003).
