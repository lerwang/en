## UNIVERSE IS A SYMPHONY MINIX CLINICIAN,…
13.8 Billion years ago,the Big Bang was Created as a purposeful cosmological seed for the Creation of our Universe.The Universe was intended to house 'mother nature',(all the sciences necessary),for the support of Intelligent Design Creation of Cognitive Human Life,aka Homo sapien sapiens,containing a Brain with Consciousness NeuroNetworks.Revision Notes on Electrostatic askIITiansElectrostatic: It is a branch of physics that deals with the phenomena and properties of stationary or slow moving electric charges with no acceleration.Coulomb’s Law: It states that the electro static force of attraction or repulsion between two charged bodies is directly proportional to the product of their charges and varies inversely as the square of the distance between the two bodies.

## Magnetron
4&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The magnetron is a high powered vacuum tube that works as a self excited microwave oscillator.Crossed electron and magnetic fields are used in the magnetron to produce the high power output required in radar equipment.These multi cavity devices may be used in radar transmitters as either pulsed or CW oscillators at frequencies ranging from approximately 600 to 95,000 megahertz.Electropaedia History of Science,Technology and.5&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Heroes and Villains A little light reading.Here you will find a brief history of technology.Initially inspired by the development of batteries,it covers technology in general and includes some interesting little known,or long forgotten,facts as well as a few myths about the development of technology,the science behind it,the context in which it occurred and the deeds of the many.

## Magnetic and Electrostatic Separation
In mineral processing,low intensity magnetic separation (LIMS) and high intensity magnetic separation (HIMS) are used or WHIMS when carried out wet.The magnetic field of LIMS is ∼1000 gauss using permanent magnets,while the high intensity units require an electromagnet to reach the higher fields of up to 20,000 gauss 1.
