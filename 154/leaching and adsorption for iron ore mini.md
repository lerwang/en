## The leaching and adsorption behaviour of gold ores
Kinetic models were developed for the leaching of gold from the ore,adsorption onto activated carbon and preg robbing at the ore surface.A variable order empirical model of the Mintek form was used to describe leaching,while adsorption wasA mathematical model for column leaching of ion …Column leaching experiments with ion adsorption type rare earth ores for different lixiviant concentrations and different column heights were carried out.A mathematical model of column leaching was constructed based on the experimental data.Two parameters (a and b) in the model were determined according to the following methodology: the ore column was divided into several units; …
