## The Advantages of Open Pit Mining Sciencing
Open pit mining does offer some advantages over traditional deep shaft mining.Pit mining is more cost effective than shaft mining because more ore can be extracted and more quickly.The working conditions are safer for the miners because there is no risk of cave in or toxic gas.Open pit mining is the preferred method for mining gold,silver.Analysis of risk factors and study on safety management.Sudden accidents always cause a great loss.How to construct a perfect safety management system is the main research content for preventing sudden accidents.The function of risk factors is the main reason for sudden accidents.The classification of sudden.
