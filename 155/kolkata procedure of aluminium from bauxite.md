## aluminium (US: aluminum)
Note: Bauxite actually contains one of a variety of hydrated aluminium oxides some of which you can write as Al 2 O 3,xH 2 O.Since this is in itself a simplification,for UK A level purposes we normally just treat it as impure Al 2 O 3.Purifiying the aluminium oxideElectrolytic Extraction of Aluminium from Bauxite and …I n examining the electrolytic extraction of aluminium from bauxite and alumina,we must first briefly explain the element called aluminium and the minerals and ores that contain this very important metallic element.Aluminum is the third most plentiful element in the earth’s crust,being found abundantly as trioxosilicates(IV) in rocks and clays.
