Concrete bleeding can have multiple negative repercussions on a project: it can prolong construction,cause poor bonding between layers of poured concrete,and make the mixture harder to pump As far as safety is concerned,the poor bonding between layers is the greatest structural problem from bleedingSegregation and Bleeding in Concrete Causes,Effects,Bleeding ordinarily occurs in the wet mix of concrete The Prime factor for bleeding in concrete is the high dosage of Water cement ratio Higher water cement ratio weakens concrete and leads to excessive bleeding The bleeding in concrete is not harmful if the rate of evaporation of water is equal to the rate of bleeding
