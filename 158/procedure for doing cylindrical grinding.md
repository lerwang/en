## Cylindrical Grinding emag
Cylindrical grinding is,as its name implies,the grinding of circular or cylindrical workpieces with the goal of achieving as much “roundness” of the workpiece as possible Here,not only must the outside of a workpiece be machined accordingly,but also its inner diameter must be manufactured with extreme precision,eg on gear wheelsIn process surface roughness estimation in grindingIn process surface roughness estimation in grinding Abstract An intelligent sensor system for on line estimation of surface roughness in the grinding process is developed The system consists of a statistical signal processing algorithm and a neuro fuzzy model of surface roughness The model is established using a set of experimental data
