## Conveyor Belt Calculations
This article will discuss the methodology for the calculations of belt conveyor design parameters with one practical example of the calculations and selection criteria for a belt conveyor system.Calculations include conveyor capacity,belt speed,conveyor height and length,mass of idlers and idler spacing,belt tension,load due to belt,inclination angle of the conveyor,coefficient of.Belt (mechanical)19&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;A belt is a loop of flexible material used to link two or more rotating shafts mechanically,most often parallel.Belts may be used as a source of motion,to transmit power efficiently or to track relative movement.Belts are looped over pulleys and may have a twist between the pulleys,and the shafts need not be parallel.In a two pulley.
