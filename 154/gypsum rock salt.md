## Why are gypsum and halite called evaporite sediments
Rock salt (the chemical sedimentary rock),is composed mainly of the mineral halite.Rock salt forms when sediments and fluids which are saturated in dissolved salt,are subject to evaporation.Gypsum and Halite&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Gypsum is readily identified by its softness (a fingernail scratches it).Gypsum comes as clear crystals that display one perfect cleavage (selenite),as blocks of featureless white rock (alabaster),and as silky fibrous blocks (satin spar).Halite (next page) breaks into cubes (three cleavages at.
