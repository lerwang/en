## Thermal Power Plant Working INDIAN POWER SECTOR
At present 54.09% or 93918.38 MW (Data Source CEA,as on 31 03 2011) of total electricity production in India is from Coal Based Thermal Power Station.A coal based thermal power plant converts the chemical energy of the coal into electrical energy.How Coal Works Union of Concerned ScientistsBecause coal is only mined in a few regions of the country,it typically needs to be transported before being burned in a power plant.Wyoming’s Powder River Basin coal,for example,is shipped by rail to power plants as far away as Georgia.Trains move roughly.

## Coal Facts for Kids
Coal is so much more than just something Santa leaves for naughty kids.Coal has been around for hundreds of thousands of years.Today,we use about 5.3 billion tons of this black stuff each year.But did you know it also takes millions of years to produce coal?CoalCoal is a combustible black or brownish black sedimentary rock,formed as rock strata called coal seams.Coal is mostly carbon with variable amounts of other elements; chiefly hydrogen,sulfur,oxygen,and nitrogen.Coal is formed when dead plant matter decays into peat and is converted into coal by the heat and pressure of deep burial over millions of years.
