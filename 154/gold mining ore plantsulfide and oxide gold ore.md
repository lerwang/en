## Gold Ore Roasting Plant
The gold contained in the ore occurs at an average of.17 opt (ounces per ton of ore).The gold is within the sulfide mineral matrix,which is not exposed (and therefore can not be dissolved by) a cyanide leach solution.Also the ore contains carbonaceous matterRcovery of gold in pyritic oresIn most instances,visible gold can not be seen under microscopic examination of pyrite gold ores.However,if the ore is ground to mesh,most times,a few specs of gold can be visibly seen under microscopic examination.
