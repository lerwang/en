## Supercritical coal plant
17&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Supercritical coal plants are a type of coal fired power plant used in more modern designs.They differ from traditional coal power plants because the water running through it works as a supercritical fluid,meaning it is neither a liquid or a gas.This occurs when water reaches its critical point under high pressures and temperatures,specifically at 22 MPa and 374 o C.Coal PulverizerRaw coal enters the top of the pulverizer through the raw coal feed pipe.The raw coal is then pulverized between the roll and rotating ring.Hot air is forced in through the bottom of the pulverizing chamber to remove unwanted moisture and transport the coal dust
