## How to Calculate the Load Bearing of Concrete Hunker
Knowing the load bearing capacity of your concrete is essential to make sure that what you plan to have supported by the wall or slab will not be too heavy and cause it to crack and break.While cracks in a slab may not seem like a big deal,the smallest crack.G&amp;P Professionals Sdn BhdG&amp;P Professionals is a One Stop Specialist Engineering Consultancy that provides engineering services in the areas of geotechnical,civil &amp; structural,infrastructure,flood mitigation,maritime,claims &amp; contracts,highways,railways &amp; transportation,dams and
