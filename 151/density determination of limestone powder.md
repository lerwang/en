## BULK DENSITY AND PARTICLE DENSITY LAB
Particle density varies little between minerals and has little practical significance except in the calculation of pore space.Porosity is that portion of the soil volume occupied by pore spaces.This property does not have to be measured directly since it can be calculated using values determined for bulk density and particle density.DETERMINATION OF MOISTURE CONTENT4&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Determination of Moisture Content 1.Introduction:.moisture determination to be insensitive over the range 12 20% moisture.This principle is based on variations of apparent density of coffee throughout drying courses.The weight is then converted into moisture content.

## DETERMINATION OF TOTAL CARBON,TOTAL ORGANIC …
2&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Total organic carbon is analyzed by placing approximately 0.350 g of dried,ground and homogenized sample into a clean,carbon free combustion boat.Each sample boat is treated with phosphoric acid drop by drop until the sample stops “bubbling” and the sample is completely moist with acid.The sample is placed into an oven set at 40&#176;C forInherent Factors Affecting Bulk Density and Available.Bulk density is an indicator of soil compaction and soil health.It affects infiltration,rooting depth restrictions,available water capacity,soil porosity,plant nutrient availability,and soil microorganismactivity,which influence key soil processesand productivity.It is the weight of dry soil per unit of volume typically expressed

Physical Properties of Limestone.Physical properties of rocks are used to identify the type of rocks and to discover more about them.There are various physical properties of Limestone like Hardness,Grain Size,Fracture,Streak,Porosity,Luster,Strength etc which defines it.The Density of Common Rocks and MineralsFor example,the density of a one inch cube of iron is much greater than the density of a one inch cube of cotton.In most cases,denser objects are also heavier.The densities of rocks and minerals are normally expressed as specific gravity,which is the density of the rock relative to the density of water.
