## Iron Making Lecture Notes
42 P a g e MODULE AGGLOMERATION OF ORE What is agglomeration: agglomeration is a technique by which the fine iron ores are converted into lumps.Why agglomeration is required : use of fine iron ore in iron making,since during communiation of iron ore some of the ores are converted into fines.This document is a proposal by KOCH Consortium to …11&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;SOVRAM and SVEDALA ALLIS,two French and Swedish companies specialised in the design,construction and supplies of process equipment for mining,beneficiation and pelletising of iron ore.SAE International,a company specialised in the design,construction and supplies of civil works and port infrastructures.
