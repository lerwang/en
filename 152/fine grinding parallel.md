## Energy Use of Fine Grinding in Mineral Processing.
Fine grinding,to P80 sizes as low as 7 μm,is becoming increasingly important as mines treat ores with smaller liberation sizes.This grinding is typically done using stirred mills such as the Isamill or Stirred Media Detritor.While fine grinding consumes less energy than primary grinding,it can still account for a substantial part of a mill’s energy budget.Fine Grinding Commercial Production LappingMechanical pump bodies need to be held to very close tolerances usually in the + .0002 (.005mm) and parallel to.0001 (.0025mm).Typical stock removal is usually.010 to.030.This is easily achieved with Fine Grinding with cycle times around 5 minutes.
