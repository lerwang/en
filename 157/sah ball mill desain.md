## Industrial Ball Mills: Steel Ball Mills and Lined Ball Mills …
Ball Mills Steel Ball Mills &amp; Lined Ball Mills Particle size reduction of materials in a ball mill with the presence of metallic balls or other media dates back to the late 1800’s.The basic construction of a ball mill is a cylindrical container with journals at its axis.Manual design of SAG ball rod mill foundations.&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;As an engineer who has experience using FEM for the design and assessment of SAG and ball mill foundations,I know that this approach can be time consuming,costly and in some cases not even a hope of being accurate if you don't have appropriate geotechnical and manufacturer information.
