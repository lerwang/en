## Copper Ore Processing Methods
2 &ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The four major steps in the production of marketable copper are mining,concentrating,smelting,and refining.In a few instances,however,leaching takes the place of concentrating,smelting,and refining.At present,although considerable leaching and direct smelting ores are produced,the bulk of the copper ore mined is concentrated.The milling of copper ores as practiced in the larger.ProcessesProcesses.Copper is found in natural ore deposits around the world.This page explains the production route taken from extraction of ore containing rock to a final product that is the highest purity commercial metal in existence and used in a wide variety of applications essential to modern living.

## The Iron Ore Market Explained
As a necessary input for the production of primary steel,iron ore feeds the world's largest metal market and the backbone of global infrastructure.The trillion dollar a year steel market accounts for 95 percent of all metal sold every year.And,in order to satisfy our demand for steel products,1.8 billion tonnes of iron ore were mined in 2014.Engineering Economy Analysis on the Production of Iron …24&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The average iron ore content of the ore deposit was de termined to be approximately 35% 11.It has an esti mated iron ore reserve of 200 million tons.The study therefore is to determine the economic viability of iron ore production in Nigeria.It is expected that the result will guide prospective investors or entrepreneurs before
