## The Differences Between Cement,Concrete,and Mortar
Cement is a fine binding powder that is never used alone but is a component of both concrete and mortar,as well as stucco,tile grout,and thin set adhesive.Mortar is composed of cement,fine sands and lime; it is used a binding material when building with brick,block,and stone.Acrete is a lighter,stronger and less expensive substitute …Acrete,a new substitute for concrete,is lighter,stronger and less expensive than concrete,and uses three times as much waste and converts it into useful building material.Acrete is a lighter,stronger and less expensive substitute for concrete Inventor Jinhong Zhang,associate professor of mining and geological engineering in the University of Arizona’s College of Engineering,developed.
