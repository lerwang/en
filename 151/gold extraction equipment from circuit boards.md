## Flashback Friday: Experiment Can You Mine Gold From Old
Aug 04,2017&nbsp&#0183&#32Since we had a large supply of defective boards in the lab,we decided to see if it would be worth extracting as much pure gold as possible from them.Copper recovery from waste printed circuit boards.Copper recovery is the core of waste printed circuit boards (WPCBs) treatment.In this study,we proposed a feasible and efficient way to recover copper from WPCBs concentrated metal scraps by direct electrolysis and factors that affect copper recovery rate and purity,mainly CuSO4&#183;5H2O concentration,NaCl concentration,H2SO4 concentration and current density,were discussed in detail.
