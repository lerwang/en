## Full Form of SAG in Grinding Mills ?
What does SAG mean? Semi Autogenous Grinding (SAG) is a method of grinding rock into fine powder whereby the grinding media consist of larger chunks of rocks and steel balls.A SAG mill is generally used as a primary or first stage grinding solution.Difference Between Sag Mill vs Ball MillSAG is the abbreviated form for Semi Autogenous Grinding Mill.This type of Mill is used for grinding large fragments into small pieces.Pieces are then used for further processing.The SAG mills are generally used in pre processing of any type of material in grinding.
