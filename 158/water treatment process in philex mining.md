## How to Control Pollution in Mining Industry?
The mining Industry has to discharge millions of gallons of water every day to the adjacent water courses thereby may cause water pollution problems in and around the mining areas Mine water discharge also forms the main source of various water supplies particularly potable in the thickly populated coal fieldsCase Study: Impact of Mining PHDessayMay 06,2017&#0183;&#32;Pollution of Water and Soil Open pit and underground bulk mining by Philex in Tuba and Lepanto in Mankayan generate ore and tailings at a rate of up to 2,500 metric tons per mine per day 9] Toxic mine tailings are usually impounded in tailings dams However,when pressure in the tailings dams builds up,especially during times of heavy.
