## Synthesis of transfer free graphene on an insulating.
We demonstrate a solid phase reaction approach to synthesise transfer free graphene on an insulating substrate by controlling the C diffusion process.Metal assisted crystallization by annealing of a C thin film was carried out to synthesise transfer free graphene,in the presence of a top metal oxide and metal layer.Without the metal oxide layer,a large amount of C atoms diffused to the top.Supporting Information A Green Technology for the2019526&ensp&#0183&enspSolid Phase Synthesis of Starch Laurate Assisted by Mechanical Activation with Stirring Ball Mill as Reactor Yanjuan Zhang,†,&#167 Tao Gan,† Huayu Hu,† Zuqiang Huang,*,† Aimin Huang,† Yuanqin Zhu,† Zhenfei Feng,† and Mei Yang† †School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering,Guangxi University,Nanning 530004,PR China
