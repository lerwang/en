## Mechanisms of cement hydration
Mechanisms of cement hydration.In this section we undertake a review of recent progress in experimental and theoretical research on cement hydration in terms of its mechanism(s) and implications for microstructure development.Attention is focused on results that have come to light in the last decade,with limited review of earlier work.HYDRATION OF CEMENT21&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;HYDRATION OF CEMENT It is the reaction (s eries of chemical reactions) of cement with water to form the binding material.In other words,in the presence of water,the silicates (C3S and C2S) and aluminates (C3A and C4AF) form products of hydration which in time produce a firm and hard mass the hydrated cement paste.

## Topics in Concrete
The American Concrete Institute Founded in 1904 and headquartered in Farmington Hills,Michigan,USA,the American Concrete Institute is a leading authority and resource worldwide for the development,dissemination,and adoption of its consensus based standards,technical resources,educational programs,and proven expertise for individuals and organizations involved in concrete,Soil Cement TopicSoil cement is a densely compacted mixture of portland cement,soil aggregate,other cementitious materials (possibly),and water.It is used primarily as a base material for pavements,but also for slope protection,low permeability liners,foundation stabilization,and other applications.
