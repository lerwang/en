## History of cement
Cement history.Throughout history,cementing materials have played a vital role and were used widely in the ancient world.The Egyptians used calcined gypsum as a cement and the Greeks and Romans used lime made by heating limestone and added sand to make mortar,with coarser stones for concrete.cement manufacturing process xsm in nigeriacement manufacturing process crusher detail.Cement Manufacturing Process Flow Chart (1)Crushing: In the cement manufacturing process,most material must be broken,such as limestone,iron ore,clay and coal etc.Limestone is the main raw material for cement production,each producing a ton of clinker needs about 1.3 tons of limestone,more than 80% of raw material is limestone.
