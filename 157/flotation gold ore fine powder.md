Introduction: Gold CIL process (carbon in leach) is an efficient method of extracting and recovering gold from its ore.By cyaniding and carbon leaching crushed gold ore slurry simultaneously,CIL process lowers the gold mining operation cost and increases gold recovery rate to a degree of 99%.Gold Flotation2&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;In this,as in all other phases of flotation,each ore presents an individual problem and must be so studied.It was describe by the use of 600 series of flotation reagents which were developed primarily for the purpose of depressing carbonaceous and siliceous slimes in the flotation of’ gold ores.Carbonaceous material not only greatly.
