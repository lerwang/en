## Concrete Density
Zhenhai Guo,in Principles of Reinforced Concrete,2014.4.2.1 Classification.When light weight concrete (density ρ = 500∼1900 kg m 3) is used for the structure to replace ordinary concrete,the weight of the structure with the same load carrying capacity is reduced by 20 40%.This is an effective and easy way to deduce dead load of the structure.Understanding Lime: an introduction to forms of lime …4&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;More commonly,Calcium hydroxide is found in the form of a fine powder known as builders lime,type S or hydrated lime.This powder of lime is often used in tanning and building because it is convenient to store and sell in the dry form,but it is less stable because a portion of it will turn back into the limestone form with exposure to air.
