## Copper pyrites is an ore of copper (i) Describe the,
Copper pyrites are concentrated by froth flotation process In this process slurry of finely divided ore is taken in a large tank Pine oil or eucalyptus oil is used as the frothing agent Ethyl xanthate is added which is used as a collector (it increases the binding force between ore particles and forth) A mixture of all these things is agitated by current of air and froth is formedExtraction of Copper and Aluminium Study Material for,Extraction of Copper The chief and important ore of copper from which the metal is most isolated is copper pyrites (CuFeS 2) Froth floatation process is used for concentrating the ore The powdered ore is suspended in water and after adding little pine oil is stirred by means of air

## extraction of copper from copper pyrites
The copper ores are mostly found in the north of India The extraction of copper also involves many steps The ore used for extraction is copper pyrites,which is crushed,concentrated and then heated in the presence of air During heating the moisture gets expelled and the copper pyrites gets converted to ferrous sulfide and cuprous sulfide.NCERT Solutions for Class 12 Chemistry Chapter 6 General,Q3 Why is the extraction of copper from pyrites more difficult than that from its oxide ore through reduction? Solution: Hydrogen sulphide and carbon disulphide (CS 2) has a larger ∆ f G (Gibbs free energy of formation) than copper (I) sulphide Thus,C and H 2 S will not be able to reduce Cu 2 S to Cu Whereas,∆ f G of Cu

The principle ore of copper is copper pyrite,CuFeS2 and copper is extracted from this ore.Large amount of copper are obtained from copper pyrite (CuFeS2) by smelting.Iron is present in the ore as trace metal.Option B is correct.Why is the extraction of copper from pyrites more.The Gibbs free energy of formation (Δ f G) of Cu 2 S is less than that of H 2 S and CS 2.Therefore,H 2 and C cannot reduce Cu 2 S to Cu.On the other hand,the Gibbs free energy of formation of Cu 2 O is greater than that of CO.Hence,C can reduce Cu 2 O to Cu.C (s) +Cu 2 O (s) → 2Cu (s) + CO (g).Hence,the extraction of copper from its pyrite ore is difficult than from its oxide ore.
