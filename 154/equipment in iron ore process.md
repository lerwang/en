## Iron ore pelletizing systems Metso
Iron ore pelletizing systems.Iron ore fines are agglomerated into pellets and then indurated using a furnace to create iron ore pellets.These are typically fed to a blast furnace or DRI plant as part of the process to make steel.Pig Iron Manufacturing ProcessIn the latest report of the engineers at Trollhattan,it is stated that the power consumption per ton of pig iron varies in proportion to the iron content of the ore.A poor ore and pig iron high in silicon and manganese require more power than a rich ore and pig iron low in silicon and manganese.This was also found to be the case in California.
