## Coal mill control process
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;The coal to be pulverized is delivered from a bunker 1 to a coal metering hopper 3 via a supply conduit 2.The metering hopper 3 is controlled,in the manner to be described below,so as to deliver measured quantities of coal to a roller mill 5 via conduit 4.The air which entrains the coal dust produced by mill 5 is provided by a blower 9.Automation and optimization of coal grinding by …29&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The coal is fed into the mill by means of a raw coal feeder (RCF) controlled directly by the controller optimizer.The controlling action of the controller optimizer is performed by regulating the rotation frequency of the RCF drive.
