## DESIGN AND ANALYSIS OF A HORIZONTAL SHAFT IMPACT …
An impact crusher can be further classified as Horizontal impact crusher (HSI) and vertical shaft impact crusher (VSI) based on the type of arrangement of the impact rotor and shaft.Horizontal shaft impact crusher These break rock by impacting the rock with hammers blow bars that are fixed upon the outer edge of a spinning rotor.Vertical shaft impact (VSI) crushersBarmac&#174; vertical shaft impact (VSI) crushers were the first vertical shaft impactors in the world.The original Barmac&#174; VSI crusher was developed in New Zealand over 40 years ago after which the VSI crushers have spread to thousands of crushing sites around the globe.

## VSI Crusher Vertical Shaft Impactor
The Vertical Shaft Impactors or VSI Crusher are one type of impact crushers,which offer higher reduction ratios at a lower energy consumption.These impactors.can be considered as a ‘stone pump’ operating like a centrifugal pump.The material is fed through the centre of the rotor,where it is accelerated to high speed before being disMR 122 Zi Mobile impact crushers KleemannImpact crusher In contrast to pressure crushing,the impact crusher operates according to the impact crushing principle.In this process,the crushed material is picked up by a fast moving rotor,greatly accelerated and smashed against a fixed impact plate (&quot;impact toggles&quot;).
