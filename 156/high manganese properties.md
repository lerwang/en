## Manganese
Manganese is a chemical element with the symbol Mn and atomic number 25.It is not found as a free element in nature; it is often found in minerals in combination with iron.Manganese is a transition metal with a multifaceted array of industrial alloy uses,particularly in stainless steels.Hadfield SteelHigh manganese steel products are non magnetic,but in tempered,poorly heat treated or cold hardened condition the steel exhibits some ferromagnetic properties.In addition to abrasion resistance,hadfield steel is pressure and impact resistant,but with parts exposed to friction and abrasion without pressure emerising,the product does not harden,as a result of which the top layer can be.
