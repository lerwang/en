## Information About the Electric Iron Invention: How an
Get information about the electric iron invention,one of the most important domestic appliances used today.Learn how the electric iron works through the principle of heating effect.You'll also find why the electric iron is preferred over the steam iron,parts in the iron,and how it works along with diagrams.The Making of Iron &amp; SteelThe BOS process uses pure oxygen,injected by a lance,for refining the relatively impure hot metal (and scrap is used for temperature control).The electric arc furnace uses primarily electrical energy to supply heat to melt scrap steel,sponge iron,or mixtures
