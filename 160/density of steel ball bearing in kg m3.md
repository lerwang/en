Materials float or sink based mainly on density.Since ice cubes are slightly less dense than water,ice cubes float in water.Since steel is less dense than mercury but denser than water,a steel ball bearing floats in liquid mercury but sinks in water.Understanding density begins …PLANET DENSITY2019 6 28&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;• Steel ball bearing or steel block approx.2 or 3 cm across • Sand What you need to do: The steel represents the core of a planet.The sand represents the rocky exterior.1.Measure or calculate the volume of the steel.(Decide on your own method for this.) 2.Zero the balance.Measure the mass of the steel.3.Work out the density of.

## Terminal velocity quadratic Physics Forums
&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Homework Statement (a) Estimate the terminal speed of a wooden sphere (density 0.870 g cm3) falling through air,if its radius is 8.00 cm and its drag coefficient is 0.500.(The density of air is 1.20 kg m3.) (b) From what height would a freely falling object reach this speed in the absence.Please help&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;So using a bigger tube won't fix the problem,because you need to reduce the speed by a lot.The way to do that is use a much smaller ball,preferably with a lower density as well.Try a 1mm diameter ball bearing.A small plastic sphere might work even better.

## Stokes law describes sedimentation of particles in …
17&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Particles in liquids achieve terminal velocity quickly.One can measure the time it takes for a particle to fall a certain distance and then use Stokes law to calculate the viscosity of the liquid.Suppose a steel ball bearing (density 7.8 103 kg m3,diameter 3.8 mm) is dropped in a container of motor oil.It takes 16 s to fall a distance of 0.50 m.Bal tecBall Weight and Density How much will a ball of a given diameter in a certain material weigh? The answer is calculated by multiplying the volume of the ball by the density of the material.$\text&quot;Weight&quot; = \text&quot;Volume&quot; ⋅ \text&quot;Density&quot;$ For example,calculate the weight of a two inch diameter lead ball: $\text&quot;Volume&quot; = {4 ⋅ π ⋅ R^3 } 3$
