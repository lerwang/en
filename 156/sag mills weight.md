## Improved mill control at Lihir Gold Mine in Papua New.
The SAG mill weight measurement combines mill shell mass,charge mass and liner mass.Powell (2006; 2009),via a series of mill charge inspections at various operating mill weights,confirmed that strong relationships can be developed between volumetric mill filling and mill weight.These relationships will only hold in the short term if ball.
