## Properties of Different Grades of Concrete Using Mix.
25&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Abstract: The aim of this study is to investigate the characteristics exhibited by three different grades of concrete using mix design approach.From the result of the sieve analysis,it shows that the sands used for the experiment is a well graded sand of zone 1 of BS882 parts 2 (1973).16 Different types of slabs in construction Where to …2 &ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Slabs are classified into 16 types.Different Types of concrete slabs in construction: There are 16 different types of Slabs in Construction.Some of them are outdated and many of them are frequently used everywhere.In this article,ill give a detailed explanation of each slab where to use particular slab.Below are the types of concrete slabs.
