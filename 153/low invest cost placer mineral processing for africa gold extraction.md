## Gold extraction
Gold extraction refers to the processes required to extract gold from its ores.This may require a combination of comminution,mineral processing,hydrometallurgical,and pyrometallurgical processes to be performed on the ore.[1] Gold mining from alluvium ores was once achieved by techniques associated with placer mining such as simple gold.Gold miningBronze age gold objects are plentiful,especially in Ireland and Spain,and there are several well known possible sources.Romans used hydraulic mining methods,such as hushing and ground sluicing on a large scale to extract gold from extensive alluvial (loose …
