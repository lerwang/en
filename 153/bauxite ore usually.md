## Bauxite Deposits
Bauxite deposits invariably contain a range of impurities,ranging from organic material to trace elements such as Ga,Zn,Pb,P and Be.Table 2.1 shows typical compositions of a range of smelter aluminas.In the Bayer process,many impurities are at least partially soluble in the caustic digestion liquor and may be carried over into precipitation if they are not removed in the desilication.Concentration of Ores: Hydraulic Washing,Froth Flotation …This process will give us the end product of Alumina (aluminium oxide) from bauxite.The other impurities of silica,titanium oxide and varies other oxides will separate.The first step is to heat the bauxite ore to temperatures of 200 c along with a sodium hydroxide
