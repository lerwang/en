## How Is Gold Extracted From Gold Ore? Sciencing
Gold is usually found alone or alloyed with mercury or silver,but can also be found in ores such as calaverite,sylvanite,nagyagite,petzite and krennerite.Most gold ore now comes from either open pit or underground mines.The ores sometimes contain as little as 5 100 of an ounce of gold per ton of rock.InThe process design of gold leaching and carbon in pulp,The process design of gold leaching and carbon in pulp circuits 14 JANUARY FEBRUARY 1999 The Journal of The South African Institute of Mining and Metallurgy Figure 2—The Carbon In Pulp (CIP) process Figure 1—Computer Aided Process Engineering (Cape)
