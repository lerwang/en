## Aggregates for Concrete
21&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;aggregates in service.Visual inspection will often disclose weaknesses in coarse aggregates.Service records are invaluable in evaluating aggregates.In the absence of a performance record,the aggregates should be tested before they are used in concrete.The most commonly used aggregates—sand,gravel,crushed stone,and air cooledAggregatesAggregate is a granular material,such as sand,gravel,crushed stone,crushed hydraulic cement concrete,or iron blast furnace slag,used with a hydraulic cementing medium to produce either concrete or mortar.Types of aggregates include Coarse aggregate and fine aggregate.The aggregate of each type is further sub divided into many types and.

## 5 Aggregate Production
2&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;With the exception of slag and other manufactured aggregates most materials for aggregate production come from bedrock or unconsolidated deposits.The vast majority of materials used in the mineral aggregate industry are obtained from surface mined stone quarries or from sand and gravel pits.How materials are extracted influences their quality.Calculate Quantities of Materials for Concrete …2 &ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Quantities of materials for concrete such as cement,sand and aggregates for production of required quantity of concrete of given mix proportions such as 1:2:4 (M15),1:1.5: 3 (M20),1:1:2 (M25) can be calculated by absolute volume method.This method is based on the principle that the volume of fully compacted concrete is equal to the absolute.

## BS EN 12620:2013 Aggregates for concrete
BS EN 12620:2013 Aggregates for concrete.BS EN 12620:2013 specifies the properties of aggregates and filler aggregates obtained by processing natural,manufactured or recycled materials and mixtures of these aggregates for use in concrete in conformity with BS EN 1 and concrete used in roads and other pavements and for use in precast concrete products.Recycled AggregatesUsing recycled aggregates instead of extracted aggregates would qualify as post consumer.Because concrete is an assembly,its recycled content should be calculated as a percentage of recycled material on a mass basis.Credit can also be obtained for Construction Waste Management.
