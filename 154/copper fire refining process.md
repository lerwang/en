Purification of copper.When copper is made from sulphide ores by the first method above,it is impure.The blister copper is first treated to remove any remaining sulphur (trapped as bubbles of sulphur dioxide in the copper hence "blister copper") and then cast into anodes for refining using electrolysis.Electrolytic refiningMelting and Refining Technology for Copper Produced …Melting and Refining Technology for Copper Produced from Scrap Charge Subject: Air Products copper refining technology can refine copper scrap more economically than traditional methods.This technology replaces and surpasses conventional &quot;fire refining&quot; of scrap derived copper melts in large reverberatory furnaces.(Air Products T echnical Paper)
