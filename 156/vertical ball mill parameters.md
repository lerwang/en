## Planetary Ball Mill PM 100
Planetary Ball Mills are used wherever the highest degree of fineness is required.In addition to well proven mixing and size reduction processes,these mills also meet all technical requirements for colloidal grinding and provide the energy input necessary for mechanical alloying.The extremely high centrifugal forces of a planetary ball mill result in very high pulverization energy and.Dipl. Ing.Th.Fahrland,Dr. Ing.K. H.Zysk,Loesche GmbH.in all of these parameters are shown in Table 1.iour of the vertical roller and ball mill systems means that particles remain in a ball mill system for about 20 to 30 min utes before they leave the classifier as produ
