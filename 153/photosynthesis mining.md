## pH of Water
The process of photosynthesis by algae and plants uses hydrogen,thus increasing pH levels &#185;⁰.Likewise,respiration and decomposition can lower pH levels.Most bodies of water are able to buffer these changes due to their alkalinity,so small or localized fluctuations are quickly modified and may be difficult to detect &#185;⁰.Enhancing C3 photosynthesis: an outlook on feasible …In addition,other areas which promise scope for improvement of C3 photosynthesis,such as mining natural genetic variations,mathematical modelling for identifying new targets,installing efficient carbon fixation and carbon concentrating mechanisms have been

## What minerals are needed for photosynthesis
Photosynthesis comes from the sun,when it shines on the leaves of the plant to get it's color.But the water,minerals and nutrients in the soil go through the roots up through the stem then.Can exploiting natural genetic variation in leaf,leaf level photosynthesis could potentially be increased by ca 20% through marker assisted selection However,photosynthesis rate per unit area of leaf does not correlate well with crop yield (Evans & Dunstone 1970;Teng et al 2004)This has led to a common notion that increasing leaf photosynthesis is not a useful strategy to increase crop

Phosphate Rock The term phosphate rock (or phosphorite) is used to denote any rock with high phosphorus content The largest and least expensive source of phosphorus is obtained by mining and concentrating phosphate rock from the numerous phosphate deposits of the worldPhotosynthesis and Respiration Article about …photosynthesis (fō'tōsĭn`thəsĭs),process in which green plants,algae,and cyanobacteria utilize the energy of sunlight to manufacture carbohydrates from carbon dioxide and water in the presence of chlorophyll.Some of the plants that lack chlorophyll,e.g.the Indian pipe Indian pipe.
