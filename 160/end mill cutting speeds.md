## Understanding CNC Cutting Tool Speeds &amp; Feeds
Cutting speed (SFM) SFM Also called surface speed or simply speed is the speed difference (relative velocity) between the cutting tool and the surface of the workpiece it is operating on.It is expressed in units of distance along the workpiece surface per unit of time,typically surface feet per minute (sfm) or meters per minute(m min).Standard Solid Carbide End Mill Speed and Feed …2018 12 6&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Standard Solid Carbide End Mill Speed and Feed Recommendations SPEEDS and FEEDS are suggested starting points and may be increased or decreased depending on actual material and machining conditions.In general,use lower speeds and feeds for hard and difficult to machine materials.Use higher speeds and feeds for easy to machine materials.
