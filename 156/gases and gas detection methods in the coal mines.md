## Mine gas mining Britannica
Mine gas,any of various harmful vapours produced during mining operations.The gases are frequently called damps (German Dampf,“vapour”).Firedamp is a gas that occurs naturally in coal seams.The gas is nearly always methane (CH4) and is highly inflammableMonitoring Exposure to Gases CDCvehicles is crucial for both underground coal and metal non metal mines For both.The most used gas monitoring technique used in underground metal non metal mines.the sensor is linearly proportional to the gas concentration.

## Coal Mines
Coal mines are typically hosted in soft sedimentary rock and caving (goafing) of the roof strata above large mined out areas is normal.Therefore larger magnitude events are expected,along with high attenuation of higher frequency signals.Low stress drops also.Gas in Coal MinesWhile proper ventilation and methods to test for gases have come a long way since they actually used animals to test,the danger of gas buildup in a coal mine is a constant and important concern.Awareness of the potential problem and knowledge of the safety procedures are an important part of keeping men alive who spend so much of their lives digging underground for coal.
