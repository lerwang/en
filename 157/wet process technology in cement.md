## How Cement Is Made
Cement is so fine that 1 pound of cement contains 150 billion grains.The cement is now ready for transport to ready mix concrete companies to be used in a variety of construction projects.Although the dry process is the most modern and popular way to manufacture cement,some kilns in the United States use a wet process.Cement slideshare•The technology is a continuous process and is highly energy intensive •At present 93% of cement production in India is based on modern and environment friendly dry process technology and only 7% of the capacity is based on old wet and semi dry process technology
