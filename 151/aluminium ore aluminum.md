## Aluminum vs Copper liquid cooling parts ekwb
Jun 23,2017&#0183;&#32;The base of the problem in liquid cooling is when you mix copper or nickel plated copper with aluminum parts,where the aluminum is the much more active material But,galvanic corrosion does not occur only with liquid cooling loops,one example is when you connect aluminum,Plastic Bottle Vs Aluminum Can SciencingAluminum cans require refined bauxite ore Environmental Considerations Both plastic bottles and aluminum cans can be recycled However,only 10 percent of bottles are recycled when compared to 50 percent of cans Cans also are more efficient to recycle than bottl Once the aluminum has been produced,it can be recycled over and over again
