## Hosokawa Alpine: PULVIS
The PULVIS,a combination of a vertical agitated ball mill and a high performance air classifier represents a further milestone on our way.The PULVIS offers a compact,low abrasion and low energy fine grinding,even of hard materials such as ceramic raw materials or glass to less than 0.5 μm in the d 50 and &lt;2 μm in the d 97.Grinding in Ball Mills: Modeling and Process ControlThe design of a ball mill can vary significantly depending on the size,the equipment used to load the starting material (feeders),and the system for discharging the output product.The size of a mill is usually characterized by the ratio “length to diame

## Ball Mill
The ball mill is a tumbling mill that uses steel balls as the grinding media.The length of the cylindrical shell is usually 1 1.5 times the shell diameter (Figure 8.11).The feed can be dry,with less than 3% moisture to minimize ball coating,or slurry containing 20 40% water by weight.Ball MillThe High Energy Ball Mill E max and MM 500 were developed for grinding with the highest energy input.The innovative design of both,the mills and the grinding jars,allows for continuous grinding down to the nano range in the shortest amount of time with only minor warming effects.These ball mills are also suitable for mechano chemistry.
