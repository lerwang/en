## What is Fine Aggregate? FA Types used in Construction
Aggregate is an aggregation of non metallic minerals obtained in particulate form and can be processed and used for civil and highway engineering construction.The aggregates passing 4.75 mm tyler sieve and retained on.075 mm sieve are classified as Fine Aggregate.Aggregate Size Concrete Engineering general discussion,Feb 18,2007&#0183;&#32;LCruiser: The coarse aggregate size number designation comes from ASTM C 33 Table 2 It takes into account MSA and grading characteristics No 1 is the coarsest with largest MSA and No 8 is the finest and has the smallest MSA Other size designations are a result of combining aggregates with different size numbers

## Aggregate (composite)
Aggregate is the component of a composite material that resists compressive stress and provides bulk to the composite material.For efficient filling,aggregate should be much smaller than the finished item,but have a wide variety of sizes.For example,the particles of stone used to make concrete typically include both sand and gravel.Aggregate Quality Construction Materials Pennsy SupplyAASHTO #57 This material has a 1 2 inch top size and is a clean material.Often used for backfill for retaining walls,used for subase for sheds,also sometimes used as driveway stone.Also used as the primary raw aggregate in Ready Mixed Concrete and some

Fine aggregates are usually sand or crushed stone that are less than 955mm in diameter • Typically the most common size of aggregate used in construction is 20mm A larger size,40mm,is more common in mass concrete • Larger aggregate diameters reduce the quantity of cement and water needed 20 mm aggregate Common aggregatesConstruction aggregate WikipediaConstruction aggregate,or simply "aggregate",is a broad category of coarse to medium grained particulate material used in construction,including sand,gravel,crushed stone,slag,recycled concrete and geosynthetic aggregat Aggregates are the most mined materials in the world
