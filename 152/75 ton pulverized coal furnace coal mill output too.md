A cord of hardwood leaves only 60 pounds of ashes,while a ton of hard coal will make 200 to 300 pounds.The wood ashes,moreover,have fertilizing value.Wood begins to burn at a comparatively low temperature,so that a wood fire is easy to start and can be maintained at a lower ebb than a coal fire,when only a small output of heat is needed.PULVERIZED COAL FURNACE HEATING SYSTEMS&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Highly reliable alternative to coal gasifier plants KHALSA brand Coal Pulverizing plants have established presence in Steel
