## Inkstone
An inkstone is a stone mortar for the grinding and containment of ink.In addition to stone,inkstones are also manufactured from clay,bronze,iron,and porcelain.The device evolved from a rubbing tool used for rubbing dyes dating around 6000 to 7000 years ago.[1]Abrasive Grain Efficiency and Surface Roughness Under …Grinding stone ratios,R for hexagonal wheels and a conventional wheel.Grinding wheel rotation speeds,n were 500,1500 or 3000 rpm,cutting depth was 10 &#181;m per pass,and total cutting depth was 200 &#181;m.The wheels were re dressed before each grinding.
