## Dilution Factor Calculator
Dilution Factor Calculator.When a solution's concentration is reduced,it is called dilution.Dilution factor is the total amount of solution per aliquot volume.It is the ratio of the final volume to the initial volume.Find dilution factor with initial and final volumes using this calculator.How is ppm related to concentrationHow is ppm related to concentration? ppm means parts per million.But what parts? The amount of particles in a suspension can be expressed as the total volume OR total mass of particles in a unit volume of water AND THESE TWO NUMBERS WILL ONLY BE THE SAME IF THE DENSITY OF THE PARTICLES IS 1 g cm3.
