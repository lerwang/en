## Mining
Mining is the extraction of valuable minerals or other geological materials from the Earth,usually from an ore body,lode,vein,seam,reef or placer deposit.These deposits form a mineralized package that is of economic interest to the miner.Ores recovered by mining include metals,coal,oil shale,gemstones,limestone,chalk,dimension.Longwall Mining Method and DesignThis mining method is not permissible in U.S.mines,so other strategies must be adopted.Two or three entry gate road systems that utilize yield pillars that tend to “crush out” when both panels are mined may reduce interactions.In the case of pillar load which.
