## Iron Ore Haematite And Magnetite
Magnetite ore requires complex processing to separate magnetite minerals from other minerals in the ore to produce an almost pure magnetite concentrate with an iron content of between 68% Fe and 70% Fe that is highly sought after by steel makers.Magnetite Concentration MethodsMagnetite is the most strongly magnetic of all minerals,and it is therefore natural that the earliest application of magnetism to ore dressing was for its concentration from gangue.Magnetite ores occur in large bodies in almost all countries,and on account of the high.
