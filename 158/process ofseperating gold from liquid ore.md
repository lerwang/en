## How gold is extracted by Cyanidation Process Refresh Science
Jun 17,2020&#0183;&#32;The process of extracting gold by cyanidation process involves three important steps that have to be looked into: The first step involves bringing the finely ground ore and the cyanide solution,Then removing the solids from the clear solution,and Lastly recovering precious metals from the clear solution by a method known as the precipitation.The Gold Smelting Process Melting,Smelting &amp RefiningGold miners have to smelt their gold in order to remove impurities resulting in pure gold.Most large scale gold miners send their ore to smelters with large equipment for the smelting process.Small scale miners still can do their own smelting using specialized kilns.Many people confuse gold smelting with melting.

## Why is separating mixtures important? Quora
Many of the substances we use everyday were actually once part of a mixture.Someone somewhere separated that substance from the mixture so we could use it.It turns out that many compounds and elements aren't found in nature in their pure form,bHow to Purify Gold SciencingDr.F.B.Miller of the Sidney Mint created a process to purify gold using chlorine,which forms chlorides with silver and other ore impurities but leaves gold unaffected.The refiner places the ore in clay pots,heats the vessels in a furnace and pumps chlorine gas into.
