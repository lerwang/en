## What is Specific Gravity?
The specific gravity of an object is the ratio between the density of an object to a reference liquid.Usually,our reference liquid is water,which has a density of 1 g mL or 1 g cm^3.METHOD OF TEST FOR APPARENT SPECIFIC,fine aggregates proposed for use in bituminous mixes,cement treated bases,and aggregate bas,Fill the LeChatelier flask with kerosene to a level slightly above the zero line 4 Dry the inside of the flask above the,Calculate the apparent specific gravity using the formula: Gravity = Oven dry sample mass Corrected displacement,

## The Importance of Specific Gravity Dynamix Agitators
The term “Specific Gravity” (SG) is used to define the weight or density of a liquid as compared to the density of an equal volume of water at a specified temperature The temperature used for measurement is usually 392 o F (4 o C),because this temperature allows water to assume its maximum densityWhy do we use specific gravity instead of using density,Specific gravity is just a comparison between the weight of a volume of a particular material to the weight of the same volume of water at a specified temperature 315g cc means the cement is 315 times heavier than the water of the same volume.
