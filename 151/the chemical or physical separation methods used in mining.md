## What are the main methods of mining? American.
2 &ensp;&#0183;&ensp;There are four main mining methods: underground,open surface (pit),placer,and in situ mining.Underground mines are more expensive and are often used to reach deeper deposits.Surface mines are typically used for more shallow and less valuable deposits.Placer mining is used to sift out valuable metals from sediments in river channels,beach sands,or other environments.Processing Methods Diamcor Mining Inc.Processing Methods.Although there are a number of different diamond recovery technologies being utilized worldwide,the two principal types are Rotary Pan plants and Dense Media Separation (DMS).Both methods are in actual fact used for bulk material reduction and require a further process for the final diamond recovery.
