## An Overview of Steelmaking Process, Steel Technology
The first metallurgical step involved in this process is to reduce iron ore to metallic iron in a blast furnace,using coke as both a fuel and reducing agent The produced metallic iron contains a relatively high proportion of carbon (4%) and it is passed to the steelmaking process in the form of liquid at approximately 1450 C,called as 'hot.A Look at the Process of Pelletizing Iron Ore for Steel …Iron ore must go through a lengthy pre processing stage before it can be pelletized a series of steps that work to beneficiate and concentrate low grade ores.This process varies depending on the ore source,but typically involves various stages of crushing and grinding to reduce the size of the iron ore.
