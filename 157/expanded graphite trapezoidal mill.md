Graphite ( ˈ ɡ r &#230; f aɪ t ),archaically referred to as plumbago,is a crystalline form of the element carbon with its atoms arranged in a hexagonal structure.It occurs naturally in this form and is the most stable form of carbon under standard conditions.Under high pressures and temperatures it converts to diamond.Graphite is used in pEvaluation of Carbon Coated Graphite as a Negative.graphite surface,which appears rougher than that of pristine graphite.This indicates the presence of a coating layer,which is,however,difficult to visualize by SEM.Figure 2.Micrographs of (a) pristine and coated graphite materials obtained using (b) Method 1,(c) Method 2,and (d) Method 3.Sucrose was used as the carbon precursor.

mill graphite for a certain time to study the possibility of graphene preparation.We found in our ball milling system the graphite itself reached smaller sizes,whilst there produced white colloid like supernatants,which had nice solubility and stability.We initially doubted they might be graphite nanoparticles,but as experiments proved,Graphite Natural flake graphite Expanded Graphite.Graphite,spherical graphite,micro powder graphite,artificial graphite,carburizer and so on.At the same time,it is a deep processing production and sales enterprise of natural flake graphite,expanded graphite,high purity graphit
