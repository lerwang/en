## Why is sand called a fine aggregate?
Thanks for the question.Fine aggregates are those who has the particle size in between 2 mm 4.75 mm.Sand falls in this range and thus its called as fine aggregate.However,Sand can also be classified into 3 parts as,1.Fine sand : Range 0.07.Aggregates for Use In Concrete2 12 2015 2 3 Aggregates • Fine Consists of natural sand,manufactured sand or crushed stone &lt;3 8” Fine aggregate will pass the # 4 sieve • Coarse Natural or crushed stone 3 8” to 1 &#189;” (or more) Coarse aggregate is larger than a #4 sieve 4 Mineralogy
