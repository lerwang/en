## Standard Test Method for Potential Alkali Reactivity of,
51 This test method is intended to give a relatively rapid indication of the potential expansive reactivity of certain carbonate rocks that may be used as concrete aggregat The test method has been successfully used in (1) research and (2) preliminary screening of aggregate sources to indicate the presence of material with a potential for deleterious expansion when used in concreteIs sodium corrosive AnswersSodium is part of the periodic table group of Alkali metals with only one valence electron They are very,very reactive,but it is not corrosive.

## Comparative Study on the Production Cost of Geopolymer,
Concrete is an artificial stone like material used for various structural purpos Today’s concrete is made mixing a binding material such as ordinary Portland cement and various aggregates (inert materials) such as sand,stone chips,gravel with water,‘Effect of sodium hydroxide concentration onLaboratory Scale Sodium Carbonate Aggregate Concrete,Sodium hydroxide,which forms when water is released from cement phases,causes slow erosion of the concrete with little heat production The time temperature profiles of these experiments have been modeled with a simplified version of the SLAM computer code,which has allowed derivation of chemical reaction rate coefficients
