## Preparing Sample Materials by Cryogenic Grinding
Suitable Lab Mills for Cryogenic Grinding.A number of aspects have to be taken into consideration while selecting a suitable laboratory mill for cryogenic grinding.While,the sample volume is critical for the decision,the feed size and preferred final fineness are important factors as well.Advantages of Cryo GrindingOGL engineers use liquid nitrogen to both chill materials before grinding,and to maintain ultra low temperatures while the mill is in operation.Chilling raw materials to cryogenic temperatures embrittles them,which means they fracture rather than bend,melt,or otherwise deform during milling.
