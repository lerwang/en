Carbon Monoxide is toxic but its presence in the Blast Furnace is important to how the process works because it removes Oxygen from (Reduces) the Iron Oxide to Iron.The slag also flows to the bottom of the furnace but is less dense than the Iron and so floats …The reactivity series&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;In a reactivity series,the most reactive element is placed at the top and the least reactive element at the bottom.More reactive metals have a greater tendency to lose electrons and form.

## Iron
Iron ( ˈaɪərn ) is a chemical element with symbol Fe (from Latin: ferrum) and atomic number 26.It is a metal that belongs to the first transition series and group 8 of the periodic table.It is by mass the most common element on Earth,forming much of Earth's outer and inner core.It is the fourth most common element in the Earth's crust.T9: Metals,the Reactivity Series and Redox ReactionsSection 10 The Reactivity Series and Metal Extraction p.waste gases limestone iron ore and coke hot air hot air molten iron molten slag 1 2 3 Title T9: Metals,the Reactivity Series and Redox Reactions Author Clive Vinall Last modified by Chris 2 19 Company.
