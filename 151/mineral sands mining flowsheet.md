## MINERAL EXPLORATION AND MINE DEVELOPMENT
18&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Mineral exploration and development are the first stage in the process of mineral supply.The stages of mineral supply are: Mineral exploration and development,in which mineral deposits are identified,evaluated,and prepared for mining.Exploration and development can beSand miners on the move but risks are highJul 08,2021&#0183;&#32;But,overriding everything in the business of titanium minerals and zircon is that while it seems to involve a simple mining process of sifting sand to extract the heavy and valuable minerals it is anything but simple,even if rivals (hard rock miners) call sand mining “gardening” Sand mining challeng The challenge for the sand miners.

## Mineral sands Earth Resources
Jun 02,2021&#0183;&#32;Mineral sands deposits typically comprise the following minerals of economic interest: Zircon is rich in the element zirconium Rutile,leucoxene and ilmenite contain titanium Trace amounts of monazite and xenotime contain rare earth elements Other minerals such as magnetite and garnet may also be present in mineral sandsMineral Sands TronoxMineral sands are within a class of ore deposits that contain heavy minerals such as ilmenite,zircon,leucoxene,and rutile The most important,naturally occurring minerals that are mined to produce titanium dioxide (TiO 2) feedstock are ilmenite,leucoxene and rutileThe minerals are either used as feedstock in their natural form or in an upgraded form,such as synthetic rutile and titania.
