## Calculating The Value Of Iron Ores In Ironmaking,
Abstract: At present we are witnessing continued large investments in the iron ore industry,fuelled by demand from Asia At the At the same time,there is a changing landscape in pricing of iron ores,with the recent demise of,The increasing role of direct reduced iron in global,ore and reducing gasses,is used as a source of low residual iron,in addition to ferrous scrap and pig iron,in the production of steel mainly through the electric arc furnace (EAF) route of steelmaking

## Iron Ore and it's future Magnetite
Iron Ore and it's future,However,the key thing for both magnetite and haematite concentrates is to have high iron grades and low deleterious impurities in the concentrate then both have high value in use,Pellets are made by taking very fine iron ore and or concentrates (eg magnetite) and agglomerating them with moisture,Iron Mining Solutions : BASF SEAlcotac® organic binders are used to create strong,low silica iron ore pellets with improved smelting properties at much lower dosage rates than bentonite Because Alcotac® organic binders burn off within the furnace,pellet porosity is typically improved and fuel consumption is reduced.
