## DESIGN AND ANALYSIS OF A HORIZONTAL SHAFT IMPACT â€¦
An impact crusher can be further classified as Horizontal impact crusher (HSI) and vertical shaft impact crusher (VSI) based on the type of arrangement of the impact rotor and shaft.Horizontal shaft impact crusher These break rock by impacting the rock with hammers blow bars that are fixed upon the outer edge of a spinning rotor.Vertical shaft impact (VSI) crushersBarmac&#174; vertical shaft impact (VSI) crushers were the first vertical shaft impactors in the world.The original Barmac&#174; VSI crusher was developed in New Zealand over 40 years ago after which the VSI crushers have spread to thousands of crushing sites around the globe.
