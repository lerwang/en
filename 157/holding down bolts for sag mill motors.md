Outokumpu Technology’s new design,TPLTM is a result of these material transport problems.As the internal design of the TPLTM approximates a grate,peripheral discharge or a grate,open ended discharge,it keeps the slurry pebbles away from the grate once.New Metso QdX4 mill drive systemMetso explained that in the past,grinding mills operating between 18MW and 28MW required a large electrical wrap around motor,known as a gearless mill drive (GMD).The Metso QdX4 mill drive system is an alternative option to the GMD.Until now,the gear driven solution for large SAG and ball mills was limited to 18MW.
