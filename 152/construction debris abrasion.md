## Improving the abrasion resistance of concrete
For hydraulic structures under water,under appropriate flow conditions and transport of debris,all of the construction materials currently being used are to some degree susceptible to abrasion.While improvements in materials should reduce the rate of damage,these alone will not solve the problem.Safety EquipmentDebris netting is an economical and versatile solution for a wide range of construction,industrial,and recreational protection problems.Made of knitted polyethylene threads with reinforced border (made of rope,binding (double stitched) with grommets 18&quot; apart),debris netting is weather resistant,abrasion resistant and flame retardant.
