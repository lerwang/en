The SART (sulfidization,acidification,recycling,and thickening) process (SP) has been successfully implemented in gold cyanidation plants to address issues associated with high cyanide soluble copper content ores.However,this process could produce a relatively low grade precipitate,decreasing the sale price when gold plants have high zinc and copper content in their solutions.Gold and Gold Alloys :: Total Materia ArticleGold’s attractive warm color has led to its widespread use in decoration.Whilst the number of protons in a gold nucleus is fixed at 79,the number of neutrons can vary from one atom to another giving a number of isotopes of gold.However,there is only one stable non radioactive isotope accounting for all naturally found gold.
