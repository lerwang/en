## Between Processing Vs Magnetic Conduction
Giant Valley Splitting In Monolayer Ws 2 By Magnetic 13the exciton energies of tmds depend on the relative shifts of valence and conduction bands due to the exchange interactions between the tmds and the magnetic substrate,as shown in table 2.How Cooking Works: Convection and ConductionCooking is all about getting food hot,which happens by either conduction or convection.What's the difference? How does food get hot? Just put it in the oven or heat it up on the stovetop.The way heat travels from something hot,like a flame or a pot of boiling water,to the food item we intend to cook,is a process called heat transfer and the different ways this can be accomplished.
