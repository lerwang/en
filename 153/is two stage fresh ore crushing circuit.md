## Froth flotation
Normally the setup is a two stage system with 3,4 or 5 flotation cells in series.Principle of operation Before froth flotation can work,the ore to be treated is reduced to fine particles by crushing and grinding (a process known as comminution) so that the variouscrushing screening circuitis a diagrammatic view of a two stage arrangement.The ore from the mine is dumped.Circuit Western Australia Making Iron Ore Low Grade Fines and High Grade Lump and Fines with J50 Jaw C44 cone and two S190 screening iron ore crushing.

## Yanfolila Archives
The Yanfolila crushing circuit is currently a two stage operation incorporating both primary and secondary crushing circuits designed to treat a blend of oxide and harder ores.The ore is non refractory and the process plant design uses gravity and carbon in leach for the processing and recovery of the gold which averages 92.5% over the life of mine.CrusherBoth open and closed circuit crushing are employed.For close circuit the product is screened with a mesh size much less than the set.Fig.6.4 is a typical set up where ore crushed in primary and secondary crushers are further reduced in size by a rough roll crusher in open circuit followed by finer size reduction in a closed circuit by roll crusher.
