Aragonite Clusters (Morocco) These natural pieces of Aragonite are beautiful specimens with the crystals clustered onto each other.They are a nice peachy brown in color.Aragonite is a calcium carbonate,orthorhombic crystal,with these particular pieces being commonly known as theExotic Black Granite Bhandari Marble WorldMarble is a metamorphic rock composed of recrystallized carbonate minerals,most commonly calcite or dolomite.Marble may be foliated.Geologists use the term “marble” to refer to metamorphosed limestone; however,stonemasons use the term more broadly

## Carbonate clumped isotope constraints on Silurian
Much of what we know about the history of Earth’s climate derives from the chemistry of carbonate minerals in the sedimentary record.because any carbonate that is recrystallized at high temper ature will have an elevated clumped isotope temperature,compared to the temperature of the pristine fossil calcite.If recrystallized material is.
