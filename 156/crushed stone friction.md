## What is the coefficient of friction of a tire on a gravel.
What is the coefficient of friction of a tire on a gravel road,and how does it change with acceleration?Design of Surface Mine HaulageThis Bureau of Mines manual for design of surface mine haulage roads covers such aspects of haulage road design as road alinement (both vertical and horizontal),construction materials,cross slope,and drainage provisions.
