## Plant Definition of Plant by Lexico
1 A living organism of the kind exemplified by trees,shrubs,herbs,grasses,ferns,and mosses,typically growing in a permanent site,absorbing water and inorganic substances through its roots,and synthesizing nutrients in its leaves by photosynthesis using the green pigment chlorophyll.Plants differ from animals in lacking specialized sense organs,having no capacity for voluntary.Dense Heavy Medium Separation HMS DMS Process4&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Dense medium separation (or heavy medium separation (HMS),or the sink and float process) is applied to the pre concentration of minerals,i.e.the rejection of gangue prior to grinding for final liberation.It is also used in coal preparation to produce a commercially graded end product,clean coal being separated from the heavier shale or high ash coal.
