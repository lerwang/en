## Qualities of Limestone That Influence Wet FGD …
High quality limestone,whose calcium carbonate content is at or above 95 percent,may be found in many seams.These stones typically are quite reactive and will work well in scrubbers when ground.Limestone,pH and calciumOne of the most common points of confusion concerns limestone,pH and calcium.Many think these refer to the same thing.There is a big difference in pH and calcium,as well as limestone and limestone sources.Knowing the difference can mean big yield and

## Alkali silica reaction
The alkali silica reaction (ASR),more commonly known as &quot;concrete cancer&quot;,is a swelling reaction that occurs over time in concrete between the highly alkaline cement paste and the reactive non crystalline (amorphous) silica found in many common aggregates,given sufficient moisture.This reaction causes the expansion of the altered.What happens when acid reacts with limestone? …Limestone is mostly made up of the mineral calcium carbonate (CaCO3).This is not very soluble,so rocks don't dissolve very quickly.But if you add an acid,you add hydrogen ions (H+),which will react with the carbonate to form hydrogen carbonate HCO ions.
