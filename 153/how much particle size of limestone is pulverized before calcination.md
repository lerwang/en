## What is the difference between sintering and calcination?
In general sintering has been done on at higher temperature above 1200 deg and calcination is at quite lower.you may calcine a powder just to increase the particle size reduce the specific.STUDY OF CALCINATION CONDITION ON DECOMPOSITION OF …particle sizes definitely influences the weight loss percentage of the samples tested.It is observed that smaller sized particle experienced rapid change of weight compared to the larger particle size.These findings agreed with Mohamed et al.(2012) that
