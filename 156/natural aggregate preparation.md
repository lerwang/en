## Concrete Aggregate
Important terms from the standard (with additional notes): Natural aggregate: Comes from mineral deposits; it only undergoes mechanical preparation and or washing.Aggregate mix: Aggregate consisting of a mixture of coarse and fine aggregates (sand).An aggregate mix can be produced without prior separation into coarse and fine aggregates or by combining coarse and fine aggregates (sand).Exposing natural aggregate and asphalt for road …Road Aesthetics Exposing natural aggregate and asphalt for road aesthetics The use of colours and natural finishes is now without doubt an extremely important element in the modern construction and landscaping of roads,highways,parking garages and bridges.Coloured and decorative surfaces can be used either purely aesthetically or to fulfil specific functional or design criteria.
