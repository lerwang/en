## Mill (grinding) Wikipedia
A mill is a device that breaks solid materials into smaller pieces by grinding,crushing,or cutting.Such comminution is an important unit operation in many processes.There are many different types of mills and many types of materials processed in them.Historically mills were powered by hand (e.g.via a hand crank),&nbsp;.MATERIAL GRINDING BY MEANS OF BALL MILLS2019 2 19&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;the grinding mills are big power consumers,since grinding process is power intensive.The electric power consumption for solid material grinding amounts up to about 20 % of the total power consumption for own needs of the plant or about 2 % of the total amount of power produced by the heat power station [1].
