31&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The U.S.coal industry serves a vital role in the nation’s economy by producing fuel for more than half of its electricity.Despite the industry’s importance,industry financial data for 2005—the strongest year for the coal industry in recent years—shows that it is a relatively small industry with revenues totaling $20 billion to $25 billion and net income between $1 billion and $2.Coal Processing Principles14&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Coal Processing Principles.While the coal preparation engineer will require a full understanding of all the classification methods and properties of coal,it is mainly the relative density distribution of the mined material and its relationship to ash,volatile matter,moisture content and fixed carbon (collectively known as the proximate.
