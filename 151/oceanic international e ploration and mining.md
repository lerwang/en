## What Are The Benefits Of Space Exploration?
Another popularly cited benefit of space exploration is “job creation”,or the fact that a space agency and its network of contractors,universities and other entities help people stay employed.Seabed ActivitiesUnder customary international law,and as reflected in the Law of the Sea Convention (LOSC),different legal regimes manage seabed activities.These regimes govern activities in various seabed zones,including the continental shelf,which is subject to the jurisdiction of coastal nations,and the Area,which lies beyond the limits of national jurisdiction.
