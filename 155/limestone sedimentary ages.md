## How to know the age of a sedimentary rock Quora
Other way of establishing the age of sedimentary rocks is by looking for the presence of igneous rocks in them.If there is an igneous intrusion (dyke rocks) or extrusion (volcanic activity,tuffaceous rocks) associated with a sedimentary rock the age of the igneous rocks will put a ceiling age for the sediments.The age of the igneous rocks would be done using long life isotopes like Uranium.
