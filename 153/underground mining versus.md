## The Actual Difference Between Surface and Underground …
In underground mining,the bedrock is kept intact,and tunnels are used to access the ore from below.Type of Ore Surface mining is suitable for large,low grade ore deposits which occur below a thin layer of rock,or alluvial deposits found in sand and riverbeds.Underground mining (soft rock)DHHS (NIOSH) Publication No.2011 162 Mining Operations Data obtained from the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) indicated a total of 925 underground (6.2%) and 13,982 surface (93.8%) mining operations.Employees A total of 59,922 employees,or 62,565 full time equivalent (FTE) employees,were reported to MSHA as working at underground mining locations in 2008.
