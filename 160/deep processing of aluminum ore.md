Reference.comIron ores in the form of hematite (ferrous oxide) and magnetite are removed from the earth through mining.The use of heavy mining equipment is necessary to dig out large pits in an area with a large deposit of iron ore; however,because iron does not occur naturally,it is necessary to use a blast furnace to separate or refine iron from the other substances in the iron ore.

The Primary Production of Aluminum How aluminum is made.Primary production is the process through which new aluminum is made (versus secondary production,in which existing aluminum is recycled into pure metal).Aluminum originates from bauxite,an ore typically found in the topsoil of various tropical and subtropical regions.The History of Aluminum and Charles Martin Hall · Aluminum is the most abundant metal element in the earth's crust,but it is always found in a compound rather than an easily refined ore.Alum is one such compound.Scientists tried to tease the metal out of alum,but the process was costly until Charles Martin Hall patented an inexpensive method to produce aluminum in 1889.

## Why Should We Recycle Aluminum?
 · Recycling aluminum saves 90% to 95% of the energy needed to make aluminum from bauxite ore.It doesn't matter if you're making aluminum cans,roof gutters or cookware,it is simply much more energy efficient to recycle existing aluminum to create the aluminum needed for new products than it is to make aluminum from virgin natural resources.Steel,Aluminum and Metal Processing Industry …OCG participates in every step of metal manufacturing from extracting and processing the ore through smelting,forming,forging,casting,coating and final sizing.Our gearing and gearboxes are found in mines,steel mills,aluminum can plants,aluminum extraction from bauxite,sheet,plate and bar mills,forging presses,pickling and slitting.

## Mining and Refining Process
Unlike the base metal ores,bauxite does not require complex processing because most of the bauxite mined is of an acceptable grade.Ore quality can be improved by relatively simple and inexpensive processes for removing clay,known as “beneficiation”,which include washing,wet screening and mechanical or manual sorting.Chapter 23 Guide: Minerals and Mining Flashcards QuizletAt metal mines,the target ore (like gold,silver,copper,etc) is often rich in sulfide minerals.When the mining process exposes the sulfides to water and air,together they react to form sulfuric acid.This acid can dissolve other harmful metals and metalloids (like arsenic) from the surrounding rock.

## How Are Metal Prices Determined?
The prices of individual metals,like prices for any commodity,are essentially determined by supply and demand.However,to assume that information on supply (production and inventories) and demand (consumption) is readily available,accurate and transparent,would be a big mistake,regardless of the type of metal.
