## Crusher
A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks,gravel,or rock dust.Crushers may be used to reduce the size,or change the form,of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled,or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore),so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.Grinding in Ball Mills: Modeling and Process ControlKeywords: Ball mills,grinding circuit,process control.I.Introduction Grinding in ball mills is an important technological process applied to reduce the size of particles which may have different nature and a wide diversity of physical,mechanical and chemical characteristics.Typical examples are the various ores,minerals,limestone,etc.
