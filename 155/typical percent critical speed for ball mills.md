## Mill Critical Speed Formula Derivation
The formula to calculate critical speed is given below.N c = 42.305 sqt(D d) N c = critical speed of the mill.D = mill diameter specified in meters.d = diameter of the ball.In practice Ball Mills are driven at a speed of 50 90% of the critical speed,the factor being influenced by economic consideration.Ball millA ball mill,a type of grinder,is a cylindrical device used in grinding (or mixing) materials like ores,chemicals,ceramic raw materials and paints.Ball mills rotate around a horizontal axis,partially filled with the material to be ground plus the grinding medium.Different materials are used as media,including ceramic balls,flint pebbles and stainless steel balls.
