## Formation age and genesis of the banded iron formations.
Banded iron formations (BIFs) are widely distributed in the North China Craton (NCC),and they are mainly Algoma type BIF occurring in Greenstone Belts (GB),e.g.Shuichang and Shirengou BIFs in the Zunhua GB,Wuyang BIF in the Dengfeng GB,Gongyiming and Sanheming BIFs in the Guyang GB.Banded Iron Formation (BIF): How These Rocks Got Their. · This rusted iron is in the different layers of banded iron formation (BIF) created about 3.7 billion years ago.The alternating layers in banded iron formations represent rock being oxidized.This is when early photosynthetic life was just trying to get started by releasing free oxygen into Earth’s early atmosphere.

## Banded Iron Formations Encyclopedia.com
Banded iron formations (BIFs) are chemically precipitated sedimentary rocks.They are composed of alternating thin (millimeter to centimeter scale) red,yellow,or cream colored layers of chert or jasper and black to dark gray iron oxides (predominantly magnetite and hematite),and or iron carbonate.jsjgeology.netBanded iron formations,or BIFs,are unusual,dense sedimentary rocks consisting of alternating layers of iron rich oxides and iron rich silicates.Most BIFs are Proterozoic in age (although some are Late Archean),and do not form today they're "extinct"! Many specific varieties of iron formation are known,and some are given special rock names.
