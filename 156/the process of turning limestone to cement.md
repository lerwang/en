## What is dry process in cement manufacturing?
In dry process for manufacturing of cement,the raw materials are dried and reduced in size to a fine powder in to grinding mill.The dry powder is called the raw meal.The raw meal is pumped into a blending silo.The raw meal is blended by passin.South Florida plant turning waste to cementStill,turning the waste to cement is no simple process.It involves sending the raw materials — together with limestone and other additives — into a kiln heated to about 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit.

Abstract Cement production is currently the largest single industrial emitter of CO 2,accounting for ∼8% (2.8 Gtons y) of global CO 2 emissions.Deep decarbonization of cement manufacturing will require remediation of both the CO 2 emissions due to the decomposition of CaCO 3 to CaO and that due to combustion of fossil fuels (primarily coal) in calcining (∼900 C) and sintering (∼1,450 C).FLOWCHARTFLOWCHART 1.Convert the following flow chart into a paragraph of about 150 words.The process of making cement is described in this flow chart.The two raw materials used in theprocess are limestone and clay.Limestone is crushed,sized,dried
