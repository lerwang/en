The prior operation (boring) created a bore centerline that cannot be duplicated precisely in a secondary rigid chucking operation.

## Grinding
Grinding 1.Grinding and Grinding Machine 2.Grinding: Grinding is a process of removing material by abrasive action of a revolving wheel on the surface of a work piece in order to bring it to required shape and size The wheel used for performing the grinding operation is known as grinding wheel It consists of sharp crystal called abrasive held together by a binding material or bond The wheel.grindingThe grinding of gears with dish wheels (Maad type grinding machines) is widely viewed as the most precise method of gear grinding because of the very short and simple kinematic links between the gear and the tool,and also because the cutting edges of the wheels represent planar surfaces.
