## Ball Mill Parameter Selection & Calculation
1 Calculation of ball mill capacity.The production capacity of the ball mill is determined by the amount of material required to be ground,and it must have a certain margin when designing and selecting.There are many factors affecting the production capacity of the ball mill,in addition to the nature of the material (grain size,hardness,density,temperature and humidity),the degree of.Ball millsWith more than 100 years of experience in ball mill technology,Metso’s ball mills are designed for long life and minimum maintenance.They grind ores and other materials typically to 35 mesh or finer in a variety of applications,both in open or closed circuits.

Mill Type Overview.Three types of mill design are common.The Overflow Discharge mill is best suited for fine grinding to 75 106 microns.; The Diaphram or Grate Discharge mill keeps coarse particles within the mill for additional grinding and typically used for grinds to 150 250 microns.; The Center Periphery Discharge mill has feed reporting from both ends and the product discharges.Ball millingCan we ball mill a clay and make it more colloidal? Yes.This 1000 ml 24 hour sedimentation test compares Plainsman A2 ball clay ground to 10 mesh (left) with that same material ball milled for an hour (right).The 10 mesh designation is a little misleading,those are agglomerates.
