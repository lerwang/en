## Processing,smelting and refining gold World Gold …
7&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The two gold refining methods most commonly employed to derive pure gold are: the Miller process and the Wohlwill process.The Miller process uses gaseous chlorine to extract impurities when gold is at melting point; impurities separate into a layer on the surface of the molten purified gold.MINING AND PROCESSINGImerys Refractory Minerals’ milling technology is a complex process where the methods depend both on ore type and on the final application.To obtain exactly the right particle size and top cut for a given application,we use a variety of techniques including compressed air,steam and impact milling many of which have been developed in house.
