The extraction behavior of copper(II) with three carboxylic acids having a bulky substituent at the alpha position was investigated in order to clarify the steric effect on the dimerization of.A reliable method of quantification of trace copper in.As can be seen from Figure 2,the quantitative maximum extraction of copper (II) was achieved at a pH of 10.0.At lower and higher pH values,the hydrophobic complex of Cu(II) Sudan II does not form completely,so the extraction efficiency of copper(II) is low.(complex of copper and excess of ligand) and give the best analytical.
