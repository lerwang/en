## Conveyor Motor Power Calculation
&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Vidyaprakash,Power calculations are typically considered the product of equivalent tension multiplied by belt speed.For belt conveyors,this may be equivalent tension (Te) (sum of friction,material acceleration and lift forces,in N) multiplied by conveyor belt speed (in m s).Downhill Motor Power Selection&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;If I understand you correctly,using the ISO power calculation procedures and you use: 1.f= 0.012 for the downhill analysis and obtain power = kW 2.f=0.030 for empty belt and obtain power = 26 kW Belt is only downhill with no near flat or incline sections.Then I advise to select a 75 kW drive for the reasons previously stated.
