## Gcv of the coal
Coal If we know the ultimate analysis of fuel,we can easily calculate its GCV.The basic principle is that there are only 3 components in a fuel which generate heat.These are.(PDF) Predictions of Gross Calorific Value of Indian Coals …India,the world’s third largest coal producing country,is expected to maintain strong dependency on coal for the coming few decades.The gross calorific value (GCV) of coal is a key yardstick.
