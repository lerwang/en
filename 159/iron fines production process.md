## Direct reduced iron
Direct reduced iron (DRI),also called sponge iron,[1] is produced from the direct reduction of iron ore (in the form of lumps,pellets,or fines) to iron by a reducing gas or elemental carbon produced from natural gas or coal.Many ores are suitable for direct reduction.Direct reduction refers to solid state processes which reduce iron.ultra fines iron ore in sinter productioniron ore fines plant The Sintering Process of Iron Ore Fines ispatguru.com The Sintering Process of Iron.ultra fines iron ore in sinter production Crusher manufacturers quotes.sintering and pelletisation of indian iron ores IIM Delhi Reduction plant or COREX.
