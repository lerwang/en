## What is Bauxite? (with pictures)
22&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Bauxite is a mineral bearing rock named for the region in France where it was first identified.One of the key components of bauxite is aluminum oxides,which can be processed to make aluminum products.Bauxite is mined in several regions of the world by a number of companies that are interested in aluminum products.Mining and Refining ProcessThe bauxite residue sinks to the bottom of the settling tanks,then is transferred to the washing tanks,where it undergoes a series of washing stages to recover the caustic soda (which is reused in the digestion process).Further separation of the pregnant liquor from the bauxite residue is performed utilising a series of security filters.

Abstract: This study is the first to show that silica precipitation under very acidic conditions ([HCl] = 2−8 M) proceeds through two distinct steps First,the monomeric form of silica is quickly depleted from solution as it polymerizes to form primary particles ∼.The Chemistry and Processing of Jamaican BauxiteThe Chemistry of Bauxite and Alumina The Chemistry and Processing of Jamaican Bauxite,In order to remove the iron oxides and most of the silicon oxides present,the ore is first treated with sodium hydroxide,The control of silica in the conventional Bayer Process is most important and in fact ores having reactive silica greater than 7.
