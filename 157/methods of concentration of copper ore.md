## How to choose a method for the separation of minerals
There are many methods of separation (concentration) of minerals: 1) Gravity separation.There are more than 12 types of gravity separation of minerals.It is used for the extraction of gold,coal,cassiterite,wolframite,rare earth mineral,niobium,zirconium,uranium minerals,and others.OreOre is natural rock or sediment that contains desirable minerals,typically metals,that can be extracted from it.[1] Ore is extracted from the earth through mining and refined,often via smelting,to extract the valuable element or elements.The grade of ore refers to the concentration of the desired material it contains.The value of the.
