## Matching relation between grinding ball hardness and Ball mill.
30&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Thus the ball mill liner life will be shorter,reducing the ball mill grinding efficiency.The grinding ball of low hardness lead to small deformation of the ball mill liner,because a part of the kinetic energy is absorbed by the grinding ball itself during collision,small deformation liner can effectively promote uniform ball to roll in the mill operation,apparently improving grinding.Grinding in Ball Mills: Modeling and Process Control2012 7 10&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;starting material can be loaded either through a spout feeder or by means of a single or double helical scoop feeder.Several types of ball mills are distinguished depending on the discharge system and these types are commonly known as overflow discharge mill,diaphragm or grate discharge mill and centre periphery discharge mill,e.g.see [23].
