## Concrete 1 cubic meter volume to cubic millimeters …
First unit: cubic meter (m3) is used for measuring volume.Second: cubic millimeter (mm3) is unit of volume.concrete per 1,000,000,000.00 mm3 is equivalent to 1 what? The cubic millimeters amount 1,000,000,000.00 mm3 converts into 1 m3,one cubic meter.What is the weight of 1cubic meter soil?Weight of any soil depends on its bulk density i.e how tightly it is packed.usually bulk density varies from 1.1 to 1.4 to fine textured soil and 1.4 to 1.7 for coarse textured soil.It can be calculated by the formula given below: Bulk Density =.
