## Flotation Behavior of Iranian Oxidized Zinc Ore Using,
Generally,flotation of oxidized lead and zinc,in particular zinc minerals,is much more difficult than the flotation of corresponding sulphide minerals The main flotation characteristics of these minerals are lower selectivity and higher reagent consumptionBENEFICIATION OF ARSENIC BEARING COMPLEX SULPHIDE …The methods used in the processing of copper lead zinc ore could be classi fied as follows (Bulatovic,2007): a) sequential copper,lead,zinc flotation method where the copper,lead,and zinc are sequentially floated to produce separate copper,
