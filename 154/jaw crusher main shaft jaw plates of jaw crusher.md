## Jaw Crushers
Jaw crushers are used mainly in first stage,primary crushing applications and are ideal for use in quarries and recycling demolition operations.The two main types of jaw crusher produced by Parker are both single toggle designs with the up thrust toggle RockSizer StoneSizer model and down thrustCrushersThere are two basic types of jaw crushers: single toggle and double toggle.In the single toggle jaw crusher,an eccentric shaft is on the top of the crusher.Shaft rotation causes,along with the toggle plate,a compressive action.A double toggle crusher has two shafts and two toggle plates.
