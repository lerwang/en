30&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;mud industry.Cesium formate brines (SG 2.2) have been developed for challenging high pressure,high temperature (HPHT) drilling operations and are produced from pollucite at the TANCO lithium mine in Manitoba,Canada.Table 1: American Petroleum Institute barite specifications API 13A Barite physical and chemical requirements Requirement.Research and Application of Micronized Barite Drilling Fluid …When drilling wells in high temperature and high pressure (HTHP) fields,the drilling fluid properties are of utmost importance.If the viscosity of high density drilling fluid is too low,it will lead to barite sag and poor cuttings carrying capacity.However,lost circulation.

## The crystal structure of barite,BaSO4,at high pressure …
The results of all analyses correspond to BaSO 4 remaining in the barite type structure to the highest investigated pressure.Therefore,the search for transitions leading to a post barite structure,in BaSO 4,must be conducted at pressures higher than thoseBarite Market worth US$ 1,944.64 Million by 2026Consumption of barite is also high in Middle East &amp; Africa owing to the presence of large reserves of crude oil in the region.Increase in production of oil and gas is the key factor driving the barite market.Barite is used to elevate hydrostatic pressure to counteract high pressure zones during drilling activities.

## The Effect of Pressure and TDS on Barite Scaling Kinetics
This work will show that barite precipitation kinetic is a strong function of applied pressure at constant T,SI and TDS.Based on experimental results,the relationship between induction time for barite formation as a function of T,P and SI was established.
