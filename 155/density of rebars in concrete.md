## Rebar
Rebar (short for reinforcing bar),known when massed as reinforcing steel or reinforcement steel,[1] is a steel bar or mesh of steel wires used as a tension device in reinforced concrete and reinforced masonry structures to strengthen and aid the concrete under tension.Concrete is strong under compression,but has weak tensile strength.Rebar.Experimental Assessment of Rebar Corrosion in Concrete …Corrosion of steel reinforcement is a major cause of structural damage that requires repair or replacement.Early detection of steel corrosion can limit the extent of necessary repairs or replacements and costs associated with the rehabilitation works.The ground penetrating radar (GPR) method has been found to be a useful method for evaluating reinforcement corrosion in existing concrete.
