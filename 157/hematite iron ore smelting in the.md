## What Is Iron Smelting? (with pictures)
Dec 25,2019&#0183;&#32;Iron smelting is an industrial process used to extract usable iron from raw ore with the use of heat and chemical agents After smelting,the iron can be further processed and alloyed with other materials to produce a wide range of metal products These products can,Anexperimental studyof iron smelting,Essentials ofPrehistoric Iron Smelting The production ofiron from an ore seems to bea simple reduction process: the iron oxide of the ore (Fe203) is reduced to elemental iron by the carbon monoxide (CO)produced by the burning ofcharcoal (Fe203+3CO~2Fe+3CO2) However,there are several difficulties inthis process: one isthe tendency ofthe.
