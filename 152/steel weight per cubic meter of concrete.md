## Steel price conversions,cost calculator
About steel Steel weighs 7.9 gram per cubic centimeter or 7 900 kilogram per cubic meter,i.e.density of steel is equal to 7 900 kg m&#179.In Imperial or US customary measurement system,the density is equal to 493.18 pound per cubic foot [lb ft&#179],or 4.6 ounce per cubic inch [oz inch&#179].Weight of 1 cubic meter of concreteOne cubic foot of concrete weighs about 144.05 lbs,so one cubic meter of concrete equals 2307.46 kg m^3 or 5087.08 lb m^3.This can vary depending on strength,additives,and other factors.ASTM.
