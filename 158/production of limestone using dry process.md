## Basic oxygen steelmaking
Basic oxygen steelmaking (BOS,BOP,BOF,or OSM),also known as Linz Donawitz steelmaking or the oxygen converter process is a method of primary steelmaking in which carbon rich molten pig iron is made into steel.Blowing oxygen through molten pig iron lowers the carbon content of the alloy and changes it into low carbon steel.CEMENT RAW MATERIALSOver recent decades there has been a move away from the wet process to the more energy efficient dry process.In Europe,for example,about 78% of cement production is from dry process kilns,a further 16% of production is accounted for by semi dry semi
