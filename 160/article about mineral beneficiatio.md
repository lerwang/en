## Biobeneficiation of Iron Ores
Utilization of aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms in iron ore beneficiation is discussed.Microorganisms such as Paenibacillus polymyxa,Bacillus subtilis,Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast) and Desulfovibrio desulfuricans (SRB) are capable of significantly altering the surface chemical behavior of iron ore minerals such as hematite,corundum,calcite,quartz and apatite.What is the Beneficiation Process? · The beneficiation process can be performed in a number of ways according to the requirement.The key end result is to eliminate inefficiency and wastage by ensuring that all the possible material that can be extracted from an ore is carried out.
