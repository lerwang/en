## (PDF) Chromite
Residues from mining and chromite processing are often toxic,not only because of the presence of hexavalent Cr (Cr(VI)) but because of the reagents and other waste materials in overburden and wastes.Chromite: The only mineral ore of chromium metalWhat is Chromite? Chromite is an oxide mineral composed of chromium,iron,and oxygen (FeCr 2 O 4).It is dark gray to black in color with a metallic to submetallic luster and a high specific gravity.It occurs in basic and ultrabasic igneous rocks and in the metamorphic and sedimentary rocks that are produced when chromite bearing rocks are altered by heat or weathering.
