## The Extraction of Iron
This page looks at the use of the Blast Furnace in the extraction of iron from iron ore,and the conversion of the raw iron from the furnace into various kinds of steel.The common ores of iron are both iron oxides,and these can be reduced to iron by heating them with carbon in the form of coke.Coke is produced by heating coal in the absence.Iron Ore: Sedimentary Rock1 &ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The primary use of iron ore is in the production of iron.Most of the iron produced is then used to make steel.Steel is used to make automobiles,locomotives,ships,beams used in buildings,furniture,paper clips,tools,reinforcing rods for concrete,bicycles,and thousands of other items.It is the most used metal by both tonnage and purpose.
