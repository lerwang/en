## Zinc processing Britannica.com
History.The separation of metallic zinc from its ores by pyrometallurgy is much more difficult than with other common metals,such as copper,lead,and iron,because the reduction of zinc oxide by carbon (C) proceeds spontaneously only above the zinc boiling point of 907 °C (1,665 °F).Copper extraction WikipediaCopper extraction refers to the methods used to obtaining copper from its ores.The conversion of copper consists of a series of chemical,physical,and electrochemical processes.Methods have evolved and vary with country depending on the ore source,local environmental regulations,and other factors.
