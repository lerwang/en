## Mineral
A mineral is,broadly speaking,a solid chemical compound that occurs naturally in pure form.[1] Minerals are most commonly associated with rocks due to the presence of minerals within rocks.[2] These rocks may consist of one type of mineral,or may be an aggregate of two or more different types of minerals,spacially segregated into distinct phases.Mineral Formulae RecalculationMineral Formulae Recalculation John Brady,Smith College and Dexter Perkins,University of North Dakota What is it? Chemical analyses for silicate minerals are commonly reported in weight percentages of the oxides of the elements determined.Although little.
