## Can We Really Measure Cement Content In Hardened …
Can we really measure cement content in hardened concrete and mortar? We can measure the raw materials in hardened concrete and mortar,but these data do not necessarily give enough information to allow us to state the cement content without some assumptions and qualifications.WHAT IS IN CEMENT,MORTAR AND CONCRETE?13 Types of Cement and their Uses in Concrete …2020 2 25&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;This cement has increased lime content and contains higher c3s content and finer grinding which gives greater strength development than OPC at an early stage.The strength of rapid hardening cement at the 3 days is similar to 7 days strength of OPC with the same water cement ratio.Thus,advantage of this cement is that formwork can be removed.
