## SmeltingProblems
Question 1 A copper ore composed of CuFeS 2,FeS 2,and CaCO 3 contains 19% Cu and 35% Fe.700 tonnes of ore is smelted to obtain copper matte.1.Determine the weight percentage of each compound in the ore.2.Determine the weight of copper matte (30% Cu).3.Determine the required SiO 2 amount used to obtain a slag with CaO SiO 2 = 2.4.Chemistry of CopperThe extraction of copper also involves many steps.The ore used for extraction is copper pyrites,which is crushed,concentrated and then heated in the presence of air.During heating the moisture gets expelled and the copper pyrites gets converted to ferrous sulfide and cuprous sulfide.\[ 2CuFeS 2 + O 2 \rightarrow Cu 2S + 2FeS + SO 2 \]
