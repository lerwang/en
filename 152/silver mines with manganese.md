## Manganese: Nodules,Uses,Facts,Ore,Alloys,Metal
7&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Manganese removes oxygen and sulfur when iron ore (an iron and oxygen compound) is converted into iron.It also is an essential alloy that helps convert iron into steel.As an alloy,it decreases the brittleness of steel and imparts strength.The amount of manganese used per ton of steel is rather small,ranging from 6 to 9 kilograms.Manganese Price 2020 [Updated Daily]While manganese compounds was in widespread use among alchemists and glassmakers,it was only in 1774 when manganese as an element was first identified.Johan Gottlieb Gahn was the first one to isolate manganese via the reduction of dioxide with carbon.The metal has since then been used in a wide range of industrial and commercial uses.
