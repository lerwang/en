## Quick Test Method for Determining Specific Gravity of,
Specific gravity (sometimes referred to as Density) is a useful diagnostic attribute when trying to determine the mineral species of an unknown mineral specimen But textbooks usually describe testing specific gravity using a laboratory balance scale that few of us have in our homChapter 5 Specific Gravity and Hardness of Gemstones,Chapter 5 Specific Gravity and Hardness of Gemstones Introduction,The answer is simple rather than cutting a piece of stone of a known volume,why not displace water with the gem? The displaced volume is the gem or mineral’s volume,Specific gravity (SG) is the weight (or mass) of a mineral in air divided by the weight of

## Mass,Weight,Density or Specific Gravity of Bulk Materials
The specific gravity of all other materials are compared to water as a fraction heavier or lighter density For example,ammonium nitrate has a specific gravity (sg) of 073 while dry ammonium sulphate has a sg of 113 (1130 kilograms cubic metre) (see table below)Solids and Metals Specific Gravities Engineering ToolBoxThe Specific Gravity SG is a dimensionless unit defined as the ratio of density of the material to the density of water at a specified temperature It is common to use the density of water at 4 o C (39 o F) as reference at this point the density of water is at the highest Specific gravities SG for common solids and metals can be found in the table below:
