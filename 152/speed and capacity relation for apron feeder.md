The Apron Feeder for mining showcases cast manganese steel aprons,SALT chain components and forged alloy steel main shafts.The impact loads are absorbed by a natural material bed on top of the feeder,and in combination with heavy duty impact beams in the feeding area,the Apron Feeder is designed to handle the toughest operational conditions.CONCEPTS OF FEEDER DESIGN AND PERFORMANCE INFor uniform draw with a fully active hopper outlet,the capacity of the feeder must progressively increase in the direction of feed In the case of a screw feeder,for example,this is achieved by using combinations of variable pitch,screw and core or shaft diameter In the case of belt and apron feeders,
