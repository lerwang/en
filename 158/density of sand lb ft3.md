Even though sand is made of rock fragments,its density is less because the porosity of sand lowers its bulk density (as shown below) (Note that the negative exponent in the units cubic centimeters indicates a reciprocal Thus 1 cm 3 = 1 cm 3 and the units for our densities could be written as g cm 3,BULK MATERIAL DENSITY TABLE Tapco IncBULK MATERIAL DENSITY TABLE Material Description Loose Bulk Density # Ft.Alfalfa Meal 14 22.Foundry Sand,Dry (See Sand) Fuller’s Earth,Dry,Raw 30 35

## Sand Calculator how much sand do you need in tons,
The approximate density of sand is 1600 kg m 3 (100 lb ft 3) Multiply the volume by the density (in the same units) to get the weight; There is finer and more coarse sand,so the density,measured for dry sand in kg per cubic meter or pounds per cubic feet,of your particular shipment may vary
