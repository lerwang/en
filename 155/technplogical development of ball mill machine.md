## Technological unemployment
Technological unemployment is the loss of jobs caused by technological change.It is a key type of structural unemployment.Technological change typically includes the introduction of labour saving &quot;mechanical muscle&quot; machines or more efficient &quot;mechanical mind&quot; processes ().Grinding &amp; Dispersing WAB GroupWAB has significantly improved the performance of wet milling technology with the development of the DYNO &#174; MILL KD,the first fully self contained horizontal agitator bead mills.Over the last fifty years we have continuously developed the mills so that today we can offer a wide range of wet milling solutions for applications in research,development,prototyping and production.

## The development of the CNC machine
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;CNC milling machines Using a rotating cylindrical cutting tool,CNC Milling utilises a machining process similar to both drilling and cutting.The cutter in a milling machine has the ability to move along multiple axes and can create a variety of shapes,slots and holesBall MillingBall milling technique,using mechanical alloying and mechanical milling approaches were proposed to the word wide in the 8th decade of the last century for preparing a wide spectrum of powder materials and their alloys.In fact,ball milling process is not new and.

## Milling (machining)
There are cutting tools typically used in milling machines or machining centres to perform milling operations (and occasionally in other machine tools).They remove material by their movement within the machine (e.g.a ball nose mill) or directly from the cutter's shape (e.g.a form tool such as a hobbing cutter).Firearms History,Technology &amp; Development: Black Powder&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;By the nineteenth century,stamping machines were rarely used in Europe and incorporating mills and pulverizing drums (ball mills) were used instead.Incorporating mills are based on technology that already existed at that time a form of this mill was used for centuries past to extract oil from olives.

## Ball Mill
The ball mill is a tumbling mill that uses steel balls as the grinding media.The length of the cylindrical shell is usually 1 1.5 times the shell diameter (Figure 8.11).The feed can be dry,with less than 3% moisture to minimize ball coating,or slurry containing 20(PDF) DESIGN AND FABRICATION OF MINI BALL MILLThis project is to design and fabricate the mini ball mill that can grind the solid state of various type of materials into nano powder.The
