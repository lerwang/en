Sep 14,2019&#183; The first factor to calculate when figuring out conveyor belt tension is the tension needed to move the empty belt,or TC.You'll need to know the weight of the conveyor belt components,or CW,the belt length,or L,and the friction factor for normal empty belt operation,or F1.Conveyor Speed Calculator & FPM Formula Guide Cisco EagleCalculate as follows: (1 2 X 90) 65 =.69 You should select the next highest horsepower or 3 4 Hp.This formula should provide you with a good estimate,but it's always best to confirm it with conveyor experts.Ask us to do a complete horsepower calculation if this causes any concerns.Higher speeds are tougher on conveyors
