## Maximum Size Crushers
The crusher has a maximum feed size.When the feed particle size is too large to the equipment caused serious damage.Whether soft or medium hard material,both cause different damage.If some of the materials are larger than the maximum feeding size of the crusher,the crusher is easy to appear stuck cavity,blocking phenomenon,affecting the.maximum reduction ratio for impact crusherDesign of impact crusher maximum size.Design of impact crusher maand imum size keithkirs.A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks,gravel,or rock dust Crushers may be used to reduce the size,or change the form,of waste Each crusher is designed to work with a certain maximum size of raw material,to a much more pact design than that of the double toggle jaw.
