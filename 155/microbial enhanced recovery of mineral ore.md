## Enhanced oil recovery
Microbial injection is part of microbial enhanced oil recovery and is rarely used because of its higher cost and because the development is not widely accepted.These microbes function either by partially digesting long hydrocarbon molecules,by generating biosurfactants,or by emitting carbon dioxide (which then functions as described in Gas injection above).MEOR APPLICATIONS—1:Microbes enhance oil recovery through,Microbial enhanced oil recovery (MEOR) methods rely on microorganisms and their metabolic products to mobilize residual oil in several different ways
