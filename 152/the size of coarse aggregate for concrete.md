Maximum Size versus Nominal Maximum Size: The specification I prepared for a project calls for “Maximum coarse aggregate size to be 1 in.nominal.” I intended this provision to mean that almost all of the coarse aggregate used in the concrete would pass the 1 in.(25.0 mm) sieve and some would be retained on the 3 4 in.(19.0 mm) sieve.How Coarse Aggregate Affects Mix Design of Concrete?2 &ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Proper grading of coarse aggregate can minimize the possibility of segregation,especially for higher workability and improves the compatibility of concrete.The coarse aggregate grading limits are given in ASTM C33 C33M and IS 383 1970 table 2,Clause 4.1 and 4.2 for single size aggregate as well as graded aggregate.

## Importance of Aggregate Gradation of concrete slab
The maximum size of coarse aggregate used in concrete has a bearing on the economy of concrete.Usually more water and cement is required for small size aggregates than for large sizes,due to an increase in total aggregate surface area.The water and cement required for a slump of approximately 75 mm (3 in.) for a wide range of coarse.GRADATION OF AGGREGATE FOR CONCRETE BLOCK8&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;aggregate for concrete (ASTM Designation: C30),and this test,used in conjunction with the standard method of test for unit weight of aggregate (ASTM Designation C29) is helpful in the selection of an aggregate blend when working with a new aggregate in which the fine and coarse sizes have similar bulk specific gravities.As a starting point
