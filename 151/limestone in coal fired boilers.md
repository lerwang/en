## Petroleum coke fired CFB boilers
The petroleum coke fired CFB boilers technology selection allowed the investors to utilize local fuel or sorbent sources significantly lowering the operational cost of the plants Petcoke fired boilers typically have a multi fuel design where a blend of coal and petroleum coke may vary in different proportionsWhat happens when limestone is fed in a coal fired boiler,It depends on the type of coal fired boiler If it’s a Bubbling Fluidised Bed (BFB) or Circulating Fluidised Bed (CFB) boiler then limestone could be added to the bed material to give a de sulphurising effect If it’s a Pulverised Fuel (PF) boiler.
