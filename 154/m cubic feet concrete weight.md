Thus,for the proportion of mix considered,with one bag of cement of 50 kg,0.1345 m 3 of concrete can be produced.We have considered an entrained air of 2%.Thus the actual volume of concrete for 1 cubic meter of compacted concrete construction will be = 1.How many square feet is 2 cubic feet? AnswersDriveMultiply your total area in feet by how deep you want your mulch in inches.For example,if your square footage is 648 and you want a inch depth,multiply 648 by 2 to get 1296 (648 x 2 = 1296).Divide your answer by 324 (1 cubic yard of mulch will cover 324 square feet 1 inch deep).
