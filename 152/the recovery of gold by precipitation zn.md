## Recovery of Gold from Thiourea,Thiocyanate,or,
Gold reduction by sodium borohydride is more favorable in the presence of Ag + and or Zn 2+ ions,while the presence of Fe 2+,Co 2+,Ni 2+,and Cu 2+ ions decreases the efficiency of borohydride The reduction reaction is selective for gold and silver over base metals in a solution mixture since the reaction is carried out in acidic mediumZinc Precipitation Stage Of Gold Deposition BloggerZinc Precipitation Stage Of Gold Deposition Metal deposition method using Zn powder ( Zinc precipitation ) was first introduced by Sulman and Teed (1895) Basic usage of this method is the electron affinity of zinc metal is much higher than in metals gold and silver,then gold and silver metals will sink and be replaced by a soluble zinc
