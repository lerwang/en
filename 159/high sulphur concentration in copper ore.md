## Chemistry of Copper
The symbol and name for copper are from the Latin cuprum,which literally means &quot;from the island of Cyprus&quot;,an early source of copper ore.Before 1982 U.S.pennies were pure copper.Now they are mostly zinc with a thin shell of copper.Most copper that is mined today is refined and drawn into wire for use in the electrical industries.Treatment of Mixed Sulfide Oxide Ores of Copper25&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Beside the ores containing copper mainly as sulfide,with a small amount of oxidized copper,many of the large porphyry mines have oxide orebodies,in which the proportion of non sulfide minerals is so high that present methods of treatment are inefficient.
