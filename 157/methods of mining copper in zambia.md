## Innovations: Introduction to Copper: Mining &amp; Extraction
Copper minerals and ores are found in both igneous and sedimentary rocks.Mining of copper ores is carried out using one of two methods.However,by far the greatest extension in the use of copper resulted from Michael Faraday's discovery of electromagnetic induction in 1831 and the way that the effect could be used to generate electricity.COPPER Copper productionAbout 80 % of primary copper production comes from low grade or poor sulfide ores.After enrichment steps,the copper concentrates are usually treated by pyrometallurgical methods.Generally,copper extraction follows the sequence (see Figure below): copper
