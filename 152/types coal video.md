## Coal explained
Types of coal.Coal is classified into four main types,or ranks: anthracite,bituminous,subbituminous,and lignite.The ranking depends on the types and amounts of carbon the coal contains and on the amount of heat energy the coal can produce.The rank of a coal deposit is determined by the amount of pressure and heat that acted on the plants.What are the different types of coal?9&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The coal formation process involves the burial of peat,which is made of partly decayed plant materials,deep underground.The heat and pressure of burial alters the texture and increases the carbon content of the peat,which transforms it into coal,a type of sedimentary rock.This process takes millions of years.Types,or “ranks,” of coal are determined by carbon content.
