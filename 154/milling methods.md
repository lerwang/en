## Milling
Milling Milling is one of the most commonly used machining methods in CNC milling machine machining,mainly including plane milling and contour milling,which can process and tap parts.And it is also suitable for CNC milling parts such as box and curved parts.Cutting Tool Applications Chapter 13: Milling Methods,Plain milling— Plain milling is the process of milling a surface that is parallel to the axis of the cutter and basically flat It is done on plain or universal horizontal milling machines with cutters of varying widths that have teeth only on the periphery
