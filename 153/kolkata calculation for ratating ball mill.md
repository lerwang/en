## Mill Speed
Mill Speed.No matter how large or small a mill,ball mill,ceramic lined mill,pebble mill,jar mill or laboratory jar rolling mill,its rotational speed is important to proper and efficient mill operation.Too low a speed and little energy is imparted on the product.Study on Preparation and Characterization of Graphene,As the rotation speed of the high speed vibrating ball mill was not adjustable,the factory default setting of 1200 r min was used It is generally believed that the ball mill has good grinding efficiency when the interstitial filling fraction of the material is 06 12 [49,50] The parameter setting of the ball mill is shown in Table 1
