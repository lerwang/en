## Bond Work Index
The Bond work index is not solely a material constant but is influenced by the grinding conditions.For example,the finer the grind size desired,the higher is the kWh t required to grind to that size.Magdalinovic [38] measured the Bond work index of three ore types using different test screen sizes.CORRELATION BETWEEN BOND WORK INDEX AND …Gamal S.Abdel Haffez 272 tedious and long time consumption.Hardgrove index and brittleness test can be carried out easily on only those ores or rocks or materials,which are soft,friable and brittle [ 3].Indices with which the crushing resistance or the

## Effect of core diameter on the Bond impact crushing work index test
EFFECT OF CORE DIAMETER ON THE BOND IMPACT CRUSHING WORK INDEX TEST ABSTRACT The Bond low energy impact (crushing) work index test is specified to be performed on rock specimens between 50 mm and 75 mm in effective diameter.NQGeometallurgyGeometallurgy relates to the practice of combining geology or geostatistics with metallurgy,or,more specifically,extractive metallurgy,to create a spatially or geologically based predictive model for mineral processing plants.It is used in the hard rock mining industry for risk management and mitigation during mineral processing plant design.
