## Extraction of Gold
When the gold has solidified,the molten silver chloride collected on the surface is run off,carrying with it a small proportion of gold.When silver is the chief impurity in the gold,as in that found in Australia,the process is specially applicable.The gold has a degree of purity of 99.1 to 99.7 per cent.Mining And Mineral Processing The Lithosphere …Once a suitably sized deposit of a mineral has been found,mining can begin.In ancient times mining and mineral processing were very primitive and the main method used to extract ores was digging by hand.Mining is largely divided into surface and underground mining.Minerals are often found in river beds,beach sands and other sandy areas.
