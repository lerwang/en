## Mining
The bucket ladder,or bucket line,dredge has been the traditional placer mining tool,and it is still the most flexible method for dredging under varying conditions.It consists of a single hull supporting an excavating and lifting mechanism,beneficiation circuits,and waste disposal systems.Chapter 10 A&amp;P Flashcards QuizletConsider the difference between lifting a light pad of paper versus a heavy textbook.The primary way the level of force of muscle contraction is controlled is by.phosphate release by myosin heads during crossbridge cycling.The latchbridge mechanism of myosin heads is a property of  muscle.cardiac skeletal smooth.smooth.
