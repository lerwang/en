The main purpose of this research is to observe the damage evolutions of LFRCWCs during a grinding process rather than the deformation and wear of a grinding wheel,thus the elasticity of the grinding wheel and the binder factor of the abrasive particles to theMATERIAL GRINDING BY MEANS OF BALL MILLSThe process of solid material grinding in ball mills has been automated poorly,because there were no methods to measure the main parameters of the grinding process,such as amount of the material in the mill,grinding productivity and especially
