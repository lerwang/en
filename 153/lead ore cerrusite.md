## Lead Ore Smelting Plant
Lead Ore Smelting Plant The most important lead ore is galena (lead sulphide).Other important ores such as cerrusite (lead carbonate) and anglesite (lead sulphate) may be regarded as weathered products of galena.Step Lead ore is initially analyzed in Step IILead Ore Beneficiation ProcessingLead Ore Beneficiation Processing How to Process Oxidized Lead Zinc Ore by Flotation The problem of treating oxidized lead zinc ores for the production of high grade lead zinc concentrates is a complex problem due to the nature of the ores and to the soft sliming.
