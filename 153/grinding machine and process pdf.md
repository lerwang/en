## GRINDING PROCESS
Grinding Process Grinding is a surface finishing operation where very thin layer of material is removed in the form of dust particles.Thickness of material removed is in range of 0.25 to 0.50 mm.Tool used is a abrasive wheel Grinding machine is a powerEnergy and temperature analysis in grindinggrinding energy compared with shallow grinding and creep grinding.The chips take away most of the heat generated in the grinding process.As in creep grinding,bum out of the coolant causes a steep rise in contact temperature of the workpiece.
