## Ammonium phosphate
Ammonium phosphate is an ammonium salt of orthophosphoric acid.It is a highly unstable compound with the formula (NH4)3PO4.Because of its instability,it is elusive and of no commercial value.A related &quot;double salt&quot;,(NH4)3PO4.(NH4)2HPO4 is also recognized but is too unstable for practical use.Both triammonium salts evolve ammonia.In.Chemical Resistance Guide c hemical r Hayward,It should be noted in the following charts that the ˝A˝ rating does not mean or imply that material will perform within original specification The chemical resistance table should be used for reference only,Ammonium Phosphate A A A A A A A A A A A Ammonium Salts A A A A A A C A x Ammonium Sulfate A A A A A A A A C B A AB AB A B A
