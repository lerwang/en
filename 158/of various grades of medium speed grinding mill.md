## Grinding wheel
A grinding wheel is a wheel composed of an abrasive compound and used for various grinding (abrasive cutting) and abrasive machining operations.Such wheels are used in grinding machines.The wheels are generally made from a composite material consisting of coarse particle aggregate pressed and bonded together by a cementing matrix (called the bond in grinding wheel …Ball Mill Critical SpeedThe critical speed of a rotating mill is the RPM at which a grinding medium will begin to “centrifuge”,namely will start rotating with the mill and therefore cease to carry out useful work.Ball mills have been successfully run at speeds between 60 and 90 percent of critical speed,but most mills operate at speeds between 65 and 79 percent.
