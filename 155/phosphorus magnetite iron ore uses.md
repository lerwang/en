## High Phosphorus Iron Ore Middle East
high phosphorus magnetite iron ore uses Iron ore of high phosphorus content coexists with other minerals in the form of apatite or fluorapatite.Phosphorus is spread on the edge of mineral particles of iron oxide and embedded in quartz or carbonate minerals and a small amount is present in the iron mineral grid (Xia et al.2011).MagnetiteFigure 9.9 presents a typical flow sheet for processing a magnetite ore using a combination of drum LIMS and magnetic columns.The ore is composed of magnetite and gangue minerals,which are mainly quartz.The flow sheet uses two stages of grinding and
