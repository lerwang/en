## Dry Grinding VS Wet Grinding Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
It appears,however,that the rate of ball and liner wear is greater in wet milling so the decision between wet and dry operation is,in cases where the choice is permitted,a matter of balancing the economic gain arising from reduced power demand and increased throughput against the increased cost of replacement of the ball charge and the mill.Increasing biochar surface area: Optimization of ball.In this work,a planetary ball mill was used to increase the surface area of the biochar,and various milling parameters were examined to see which had the largest effect on surface area.The weight ratio of milling media to biochar and the mass of solvent used in wet milling were the most important milling parameters in maximizing surface area.
