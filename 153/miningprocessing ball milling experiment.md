20L ball mill lab experiment A horizontal cylinder is rotated at a predetermined speed that sets the balls into a tumbling and cascading motion which impact the solids in a very predictable and controllable fashion.Because the process takes several hours,the particles will not only be finely milled,but will exhibit a narrow particle size distribution.Reliable Mechanochemistry: Protocols for Reproducible …&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Preliminary kinetic studies are essential to determine the necessary milling time to achieve equilibrium.Only then can exquisite phase composition curves be obtained as a function of the solvent concentration under ball mill liquid assisted grinding (LAG).

## Lab Report 1 and 2: PRACTICAL 1 : BALL MILLING
Ball Mill is the equipment to be used for size reduction.It is a kind of grinder used for intermediate or fine grinding.Ball mill is a metal cylinder which rotates about its horizontal axis.The coarse sugar charged along with the metal balls breaks to fine powder by impact.Pharmaceutical Technology: PRACTICAL I : BALL MILLINGThis means that there is much more salt has weight greater than 500 &#181;m.This shows that the process of ‘ball milling’ is not effective in reducing the size particle of coarse salt.This is because there are some errors we had did during the experiment even though we
