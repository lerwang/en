## How gold is made
Gold is generally found in two types of deposits: lode (vein) or placer deposits; the mining technique used to extract the gold depends upon the type of deposit.Once extracted,the gold is refined with one of four main processes: floatation,amalgamation,cyanidation,or carbon in pulp.Each process relies on the initial grinding of the gold.Gold Processing Methods &amp; Gold Ore ExtractionOf all the methods of extracting gold &amp; processing it from its ore,I used a few to evaluate two principal flowsheets in this case study.The flowsheets utilized operations that involved flotation,cyanidation and gravity concentration.Tests that mirror each of these unit operations were utilized to evaluate the principal flowsheets.This page offers a comparative review of gold recovery.

## How gold is made
Gold is generally found in two types of deposits: lode (vein) or placer deposits; the mining technique used to extract the gold depends upon the type of deposit.Once extracted,the gold is refined with one of four main processes: floatation,amalgamation,cyanidation,or carbon in pulp.Each process relies on the inTypes of Milling Cutters Used in Machining Process.&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;These types of milling cutters have the cutting teeth on the both sides.We use end mill more in the vertical milling processes.High speed steel or the cemented carbide are used to create end mills.High speed steel is also called as HS or HSS.The high speed steel doesn’t loose its hardness when the temperature increases.
