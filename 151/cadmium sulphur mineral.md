## Cadmium sulfide Podcast Chemistry World
In chemistry,yellow is not unheard of sulfur springs to mind immediately yet a good strong yellow is rare enough to comment on,and cadmium sulfide delivers it with bells on This simple compound,pairing one cadmium atom with one of sulfur,occurs naturally both as a pure mineral and,more frequently,as an impurity in zinc orsulfide mineral Definition,Examples,Identification,Sulfide mineral: Sulfide mineral,any member of a group of compounds of sulfur with one or more metals Most of the sulfides are simple structurally,exhibit high symmetry in their crystal forms,and have many of the properties of metals,including metallic luster and electrical conductivity

## Cadmium Toxicity in Plants and Role of Mineral Nutrients,
Cadmium (Cd) is a toxic heavy metal that enters the environment through various anthropogenic sources,and inhibits plant growth and development Cadmium toxicity may result from disturbance in plant metabolism as a consequence of disturbance in the uptake and translocation of mineral nutrientsPure Organic Sulfur Sourced from Louisiana pine trees,Sulfur with an atomic number of 16 is known to bond with almost every other mineral Sulfur has demonstrated its ability to detoxify heavy metals in conjunction with the transport of oxygen across the cell membrane,thus allowing regeneration
