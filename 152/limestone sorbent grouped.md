The sorbent CaO is included in the evaluation because it may be superior to natural sorbent limestone when it is in the form of active CaO carried on an inert support such as alumina.It also provides a comparison between the well known limestone potential and the alterna tive sorbent potential.Flue gases: Gypsum dewatering in desulphurisation.Wet FGD technologies can be grouped into those that use calcium based sorbents,magnesium ,potassium or sodium based sorbents,ammonia,and seawater.In particular,limestone based gypsum processes dominate for large scale coal fired plants.They utilise a fairly inexpensive and widely available sorbent limestone.

Duct Sorbent Injection DSI is intended to provide SO2 control directly in the flue gas duct between the air preheater and the particulate control device.In this process,dry sorbent (most often hydrated lime) is injected into the flue gas downstream of the boiler's air preheater.Water is injected separately from the sorbent.Final Report Summary• Limestone is a cheap and widely available CO2 sorbent.• Fuel flexibility both on the existing power plant and in the oxycalciner.• The flue gas does not require pretreatment,such as SO2 removal.• CO2 produced in the calciner has very high concentration (around 95 vol.% after water condensation).
