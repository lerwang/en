## Mining and Extraction: Oxide Ores
Copper is refined from ores in the ground,either through underground or open pit mines.Most of the copper ores mined today are oxide or sulfide ores.Extraction of sulfide ores is covered in more detail in Copper Mining and Extraction: Sulfide Ores (11 14),but is introduced here because an important by product of this process is used for the extraction of oxide ores.Purifying copper by electrolysis&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Copper is purified by electrolysis.Electricity is passed through solutions containing copper compounds,such as copper(II) sulfate.The anode (positive electrode) is made from impure copper and.
