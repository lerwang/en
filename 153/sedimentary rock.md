## Sedimentary Rocks
Sedimentary rocks are deposited in layers,usually underwater,with the oldest layers on the bottom and the youngest layers on the top.One important feature of sedimentary rocks is the size of the grains that form them.The names of these grains depend upon their size.The grain size tells us about the energy of the currents&nbsp;.How to use &quot;sedimentary rock&quot; in a sentenceThe most recent layers of sedimentary rock were formed as the seabed of the ancient Champlain Sea at the end of the last ice age about 14,000 years ago.The principle of superposition states that a sedimentary rock layer in a tectonically undisturbed sequence is younger than the one beneath it and older than the one above it.

## Sedimentary rock
Sedimentary rocks are rocks formed from sediment.They are deposited over time,and often show layers which can be seen in cliffs.Other types of rock are igneous rock and metamorphic rock.Sediments are usually formed from matter which falls to the bottom of oceans and lakes.The matter includes tiny pieces of other rocks,and dead animals.Sedimentary Rock Facts for Kids Information &amp; ExamplesEnjoy our awesome range of Earth facts for kids.Check out the cool trivia and have fun learning about some of our planet&#39;s most amazing features.Sedimentary Rock Facts for Kids Information &amp; Examples Sedimentary Rock Facts.Enjoy our sedimentary rock facts for kids.Find interesting information and a range of&nbsp;.

## How does sediment become sedimentary rock
In order for an igneous rock to be changed to a sedimentary rock the rock must be weathered down into,well,some form of sediment (sand,gravel,ect.) and then have pressure applied to it to.Sedimentary Rock The Canadian Encyclopedia7 Feb 2006.Only about 5% of the Earth&#39;s crust is composed of sedimentary rocks,but they cover 70 75% of the exposed surface and contain many economically important minerals,as well as coal and petroleum.As exposed at the surface,the most important types by volume are shale 50%,sandstone 30% and&nbsp;.

## Sedimentary Rock: Face of the Earth
The forces of weather break rocks into small pieces that are carried away and deposited elsewhere.These small pieces are often deposited in shallow seas or lakes as sediments.As the layers of deposits pile up,perhaps over millions of years,pressure from the weight of the sediments above turns the lower layers into&nbsp;.Sedimentary rockSedimentary rock is one of the three main rock groups (along with igneous and metamorphic rocks) and is formed in four main ways: by the deposition of the weathered remains of.
