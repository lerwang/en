 · To figure the speed the belt is moving you need to know the diameter of the contact wheel,multiply that times 3.141592(pi) to get the circumference of the wheel.Then multiply that times the rpm of the motor.That will give you inches per minute.To figure feet per minute just divide by 12.(diameter of wheel x pi) x rpm of motor = inches per.Screw Conveyor Capacity Engineering GuideCapacity is defined as the weight or volume per hour of a bulk material that can be safely and feasibly conveyed using a screw conveyor.Screw conveyor diameter is determined by multiple factors including capacity.The following steps are required for proper screw conveyor selection: Calculate required capacity in cubic feet per hour (ft 3 hr).
