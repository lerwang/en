## How Coal Works Union of Concerned Scientists
The Clean Air Act,especially after amendments passed in 1990,drove a shift toward low sulfur coal as one of the main methods of reducing sulfur dioxide emissions from coal plants.Since the predominantly subbituminous coal west of the Mississippi emits much less sulfur per unit of energy,this trend favored western surface mines as a dominant source of new coal production.COAL FIRED POWER PLANTS:SULFUR DIOXIDE REMOVAL …SULFUR DIOXIDE REMOVAL There are no combustion strategies that can be used to control the generation of sulfur dioxide in PC plants.If sulfur is present in coal it will be converted into sulfur dioxide during combustion.The only recourse is to capture the sulfur.
