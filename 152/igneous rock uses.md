## Peridotite Characteristics and uses Actforlibraries.org
Peridotite Characteristics and uses.Earth Science.Peridotite is an igneous type of rock that is composed primarily of olivine.Peridotite has a coarse grain and may contain small amounts of other elements,such as spinel,chromite and plagioclase and amphibole.Peridotite is abundant on Earth and has a number of uses.12 Uses of Rocks9&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Uses of Rock.Uses of rocks in Civil and Highway Engineering are: Blocks of stones are used in foundations,walls,bridge pier,abutments,lighthouses,aqueducts,and retaining walls.Rocks are used for masonry work,lintels,and vertical columns,covering floors of the building.Flags or thin slabs are used for paving,roofing,etc.

## Peridotite (Dunite) Rock Definiton,Properties and Uses
The rock is usually found interlayered with iron and magnesium rich rocks in the lower parts of layered igneous rock bodies,where its denser crystals first form through selective crystallization and then settle to the bottom of still fluid or semi solid crystallizing mushes.Igneous rocks2 &ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Igneous rocks are formed from molten rock that has cooled and solidified.The inside of the Earth is very hot hot enough to melt rocks.Molten (liquid) rock is called magma.When the magma cools.

## Pictures and Descriptions of Igneous Rock Types
Igneous rocks are those that form via the process of melting and cooling.If they erupt from volcanoes onto the surface as lava,they are called extrusive rocks.By contrast,Intrusive rocks are formed from magma that cools underground.If the intrusive rock cooled underground but near the surface,it is called subvolcanic or hypabyssal,and often has visible,but tiny mineral grains.What are some common uses for igneous rocks? + …Intrusive igneous rocks form when magma hardens below the earth's surface.Granite is an example.Granite is used in countertops,statues and tombstones because of its durability.Gabbro is another intrusive igneous rock which contains profitable amounts of gold and silver.

## Diorite Rock Composition,Formation and Uses Area
Diorite is coarse grained intrusive igneous rock that commonly mineralogy is plagioclase feldspar and dark colored minerals such as hornblende and biotite.It usually occurs dikes,sills and intrusions with continental crust.Diorite is usually grey to dark grey in colour,but it can also be black or bluish grey,and frequently has a greenish cast.Igneous Rocks FactsExtrusive igneous rock tends to be glassy in texture because their formation occurs very rapidly.Examples of extrusive igneous rock include pumice and basalt.Pumice is an extrusive igneous rock used in many products such as toothpaste,cement,and cosmetic products.Basalt is an extrusive igneous rock used in constructing buildings and statues.

## Basalt: Igneous Rock
What is Basalt? Basalt is a dark colored,fine grained,igneous rock composed mainly of plagioclase and pyroxene minerals.It most commonly forms as an extrusive rock,such as a lava flow,but can also form in small intrusive bodies,such as an igneous dike or a thin sill.It has a composition similar to gabbro.The difference between basalt and gabbro is that basalt is a fine grained rock while.rockIgneous rock forms from magma when it cools and solidifies.Magma is a molten mixture of rock forming minerals,gases,and steam produced at high temperatures deep within Earth,at underground depths of about 30 to 120 miles (50 to 200 kilometers).The word igneous comes from …
