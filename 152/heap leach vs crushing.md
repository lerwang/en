## Gold Heap Leaching
19&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Heap Leaching.Heap leaching is a process that grinds gold mine with low grade to certain particles,heap upon the leakage proof bottom mat that concreted by pitch,concrete or plastic cloth,spray the low concentration cyanide solution,alkaline solution ， nontoxic solvent ， dilute sulphuric acid on the stock heap,make the gold dissolve ， the solution with gold heap up,then use.pH ORP measurement Cyanide leaching process11&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Heap leaching Heap leaching applies often to low grade ore.The processing plant stacks the ore in a heap on an impermeable liner.Stacking is often preceded by a crushing step to increase the surface area of the ore and permeability of the heap.A sprinkler system above the heap then applies a leaching solution.
