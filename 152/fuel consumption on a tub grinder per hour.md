## fuel consumption formulas and tables Barrington,
The fuel consumption rate for many makes of Diesel Engines can be found in a range between 0380 & 0450 lbs hp hour; 172 & 181 grams hp hour; 231 & 243 grams kW hour This does not represent a big difference in fuel consumption per power unit between most normal naturally aspirated diesel engines,while turbocharged engines,Gas Consumption of older 2 vs 4 stroke engines???,Jul 30,2011&#0183;&#32;Fuel consumption is a rather difficult number to pin down in the categories you are interested in For example slow cruising may be idle speed,it may be just on plane As for water skiing at 32 MPH,that also is hard to pin down because of the boat,the size the people being towed and the load in the boat
