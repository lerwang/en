## Dynamic Compaction
The major advantage of adopting the dynamic compaction method is its very high production rate (it can be used to treat an area of &gt; 10 4 m 2 month).Moreover,this method is effective both in saturated and nonsaturated soils.Manufacture of Concretemanufacturing of concrete,manufacturing of concrete pdf,manufacturing of concrete ppt,ready mix concrete production process,batching process of concrete,ready mix concrete manufacturing.
