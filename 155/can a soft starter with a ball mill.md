## When do you need a soft starter for an AC motor?
A soft starter (solid state starter) allows current to be limited (top) during motor starting.The corresponding torque reduction (bottom) is proportional to the square of the reduction in voltage.It’s important to note that a VFD (variable frequency drive) can provide the same controlled starting and stopping functions that a soft starter provides,albeit in a different way — by varying.
