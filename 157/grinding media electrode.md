## Battery
Lithium ion batteries are basically comprised of a negative electrode (anode),a positive electrode (cathode) and a separator membrane.The individual electrodes are made up of conductor foils that are coated with a mixture of binders,active materials and additives (battery slurries).HighPerformance Graphite Electrode Machining :Cutter Requirements.Graphite is a highly abrasive material,and tends to wear out cutters quickly.One of the greatest difficulties encountered when machining graphite is that cutter wear can reach unacceptable levels within the time required to machine a single,multifeatured electrode.
