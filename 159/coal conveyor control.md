## Coal Industry Archives
Coal is a burnable carbonaceous rock,classified as sedimentary.Coal is divided into four major types,based generally on the amount of transformation undergone from the earlier plant and peat stages,heating value and other characteristics: Lignite.A brownish black coal with generally high moisture and ash content and the lowest carbon content.Coal Belt Conveyor PID Controller Parameter …The coal belt conveyor is an important transport equipment to transfer the coal between the mining working space and the ground.In the traditional belt conveyor control system,there are some disadvantages such as movement quiver with switch relay controller.In this paper,a control strategy using neural network theory to optimize the parameters of the speed PID controller is proposed to.
