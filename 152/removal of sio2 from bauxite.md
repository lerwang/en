The bulk sampling work also identified an extensive deep bauxite layer grading more than 48% Al2O3 and less than 3% SiO2 which is the highest quality gibbsite trihydrate bauxite in eastern Australia.Mining this deep bauxite requires removal of 6 to 10 metres of an overlying layer of red mudstone that is probably a sediment that accumulated.Silicon dioxide2 &ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Silicon dioxide,also known as silica,is an oxide of silicon with the chemical formula Si O 2,most commonly found in nature as quartz and in various living organisms.In many parts of the world,silica is the major constituent of sand.Silica is one of the most complex and most abundant families of materials,existing as a compound of several minerals and as synthetic product.

A process for removing silica from bauxite is disclosed.The method includes the step of mixing bauxite with a caustic liquor to form a mixture and to dissolve and stabilise at least a substantial part of the reactive silica from the bauxite.The caustic liquor is selected to have a high caustic concentration and a high alumina content.Weipa The Australian Aluminium CouncilWeipa bauxite was first reported in the late 1700s in remote north Queensland,about 600km by air from Cairns.Geologist Harry Evans was responsible for the delineation and development of the Weipa resource in 1955 and commercial mining began in 1961.
