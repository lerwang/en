## Flue gas desulfurization
The Chendu power plant in China started up such a flue gas desulfurization unit on a 100 MW scale in 1998.The Pomorzany power plant in Poland also started up a similar sized unit in 2003 and that plant removes both sulfur and nitrogen oxides.Both plants are reported to be operating successfully.Experimental Study on Optimization of Wet Desulfurization.In this paper,the output can not meet the operating requirements problems of power plant desulfurization device wet mill system operation,site of the optimization test of wet mill system,optimization and adjustment,wet mill output and fineness of limestone reached or better than the design value,the operation time was shortened,and achieved good economic and social benefits.

## Dry mills and wet mills,which one is more suitable for.
Dry mills and wet mills,which one is more suitable for desulfurization limestone grinding? Posted: 2019 10 21.The desulfurization mill mainly uses a mill to process the desulfurizer,that is,limestone.The fineness of the limestone fine powder generally used in desulfurization of power plants and steel plants is 300 mesh.Of course,many enterprises are enterprises that produce high quality.Flue gas desulfurizationValmet’s FGD system is applicable for power plants in a wide size range from small to medium (20 250 MWe).Contrary to semi dry FGD systems,it features a cost efficient design in which a multi inlet absorber can be shared by several boilers or engines.
