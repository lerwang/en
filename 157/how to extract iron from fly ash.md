## Characterisation and removal of iron from fly ash of.
In an attempt to remove iron from fly ash by selective magnetic coating followed by magnetic separation,the effects of pH,magnetic intensity,colloidal magnetite concentration and addition of sodium oleate have been studied.It is possible to remove around 92% iron at an optimum pH of ∼ 7.1 and magnetic intensity of ∼11.8 K gauss.Latrobe Magnesium successful in removing more iron …31&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The primary testing of the fly ash is to efficiently harvest the rich magnesium content from the fly ash that remains in tailings from coal fired power stations.Insofar as Latrobe Magnesium can extract other raw ingredients for cement and iron production,the economics of the process further improve.
