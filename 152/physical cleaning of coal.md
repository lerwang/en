## Refined coal Wikipedia
Refined coal is the product of the application of a coal upgrading technology that removes moisture and certain pollutants from lower rank coals such as sub bituminous and lignite (brown) coals and raising their calorific valu Coal refining or upgrading technologies are typically pre combustion treatments and or processes that alter the characteristics of a coal before it is burnedMercury in USGSPhysical coal cleaning is a viable method of reducing mercury that enters the combustion system and,therefore,reducing mercury that enters the atmosphere The mean mercury concentration of eastern US coals may be less than reported,if the impact of physical coal cleaning is considered

## Desulphurization of Coal to Protect the Environment.
The major coal desulphurization technologies prior to combustion are physical coal cleaning,chemical and biological methods.Each has some technical and economical limitations.Physical coal cleaning can only remove limited amount of inorganic sulphur due to insufficient liberation.chemical coal cleaning cnkiThe method with which sulfur was removed from coal before it is burned has the most broad prospects among many methods of controlling sulfur dioxide emissions.This paper analyses and probes into forms of sulfur in coal and biological desulfurization,chemical coal cleaning and advanced physical coal cleaning.
