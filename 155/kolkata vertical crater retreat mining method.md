## Definition of vertical crater retreat mining
A patented mining method in which large,parallel,vertical drillholes permit placement of nearly spherical explosive charges,such that horizontal slices of ore are then broken into an undercut; applicable to ore of only moderate strength.Ref: SME,1VERTICAL CRATER RETREATVCR MINING Vertical crater retreat (VCR) mining is a method originally developed by the Canadian mining company INCO.Today,VCR is an established mining method used …

## Vertical retreat mining Britannica
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;In vertical retreat mining the stope does not take the shape of a vertical slot.Instead,the trough serves as a horizontal slot,and only short lengths at the bottoms of the blastholes are charged with explosives,blowing a horizontal slice of ore downward into the.NIOSHTIC Publications SearchLarge diameter (6 1 in) blastholes were an integral part of the stoping method at each mine.A true vertical crater retreat (VCR) method was used at the Homestake Mine,while a vertical bench mining method (VBM) was used at the Carr Fork Mine.

## Abstract
This method is not as popular as it once was.Sublevel stoping,vertical crater retreat (VCR),sublevel caving,and cut and fill are all methods that can be applied to ore bodies where shrinkage stoping is feasible.The model is valid.for operations with daily miningGeotechnical aspects of vertical crater mining method in …Synopsis Vertical Crater Retreat is compared to other open stoping methods.Various geotechnical factors have been considered including the effects of stress concentration,jointing,dynamic stresses superimposed by blasting vibrations,amount of development required and shrinkage draw.
