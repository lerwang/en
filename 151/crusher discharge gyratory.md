## Cone crusher with peripherally driven gyratory head
A conical crusher head of a gyratory cone crusher is supported by a spider arm cradle.Radially disposed and circumferentially evenly spaced spider arm type support members of the cradle extend outwardly through an annular material discharge path in the lower.Gyratory CrusherAs in the jaw crusher,maximum movement of the head occurs near the discharge.This tends to relieve the choking due to swelling.The gyratory crusher is a good example of arrested crushing.The spindle is free to turn on its axis in the eccentric sleeve,so that during crushing the lumps are compressed between the
