This has been for long the most widely used method for the production of iron powder.Selected ore is crushed,mixed with carbon,and passed through a continuous furnace where reaction takes place leaving a cake of sponge iron which is then further treated byProducing Activated CarbonThe Carbon Manufacturing Process How to Make Activated Carbon The production process of activated,or active,carbon exists in two forms.A carbonaceous source,which can exist as coal,peat,or any organic carbonaceous material is carbonized,which means the pure carbon is extracted by a heating method known as pyrolysis.

## How is Carbon Fiber Made? ZOLTEK
This process is called carbonization and leaves a fiber composed of long,tightly interlocked chains of carbon atoms with only a few non carbon atoms remaining.While ZOLTEK has its own trade secrets,we’re also eager to encourage a broader understanding of carbon …How carbon fiber is madeThis process proved to be inefficient,as the resulting fibers contained only about 20% carbon and had low strength and stiffness properties.In the early 1960s,a process was developed using polyacrylonitrile as a raw material.This produced a
