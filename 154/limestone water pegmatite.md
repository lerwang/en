## Geological History and Hong Kong Rocks
Detailed studies of the rocks enable the geological history and the evolution of the tectonic setting to be deciphered.The large variety of rock types present in Hong …The Density of Common Rocks and MineralsThe densities of rocks and minerals are normally expressed as specific gravity,which is the density of the rock relative to the density of water.This isn't as complex as you may think because water's density is 1 gram per cubic centimeter or 1 g cm 3.Therefore.

## Pegmatite
pegmatite fluids are created by removal of volatiles from metamorphic rocks,particularly felsic gneiss,to liberate the right constituents and water,at the right temperature Magmatic pegmatites tend to occur in the aureoles of granites in most cases,and are usually granitic in character,often closely matching the compositions of nearby granites.Lithium: Sources,Production,Uses,and Recovery OutlookLithium is currently extracted from 13 pegmatite deposits; the largest production mine is Greenbushes in Australia.14 Other potential sources of supply of lithium are clays and seawater.13,15 Lithium from clays can be recovered by limestone gypsum roasting10
