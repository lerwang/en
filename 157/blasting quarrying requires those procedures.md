## QGN 11 Handling Explosives In Underground Mines
Page 3 of 45 Handling Explosives In Underground Mines This Guidance Note has been issued by Safety and Health of the Department of Natural Resources and Mines.This Guidance Note is not a Guideline as defined in the Mining and Quarrying Safety and HealthQuarry industry worker competenceThe competence of those involved in blasting operations (eg shotfirers and explosives supervisors) is crucial.Blasting is potentially one of the most dangerous operations in quarrying.As well as the risks associated with the storage,transport and handling of explosives,there are risks associated with firing the shot itself both on and off site (eg should flyrock go beyond the danger zone).
