## Carbon in pulp
Carbon in pulp (CIP) is an extraction technique for recovery of gold which has been liberated into a cyanide solution as part of the gold cyanidation process.[1] Introduced in the early 1980s,Carbon in Pulp is regarded as a simple and cheap process.As such it is used in most industrial applications where the presence of competing silver or.elution process for carbon active in the gold mining09 08 2020&#0183;&#32;elution process for carbon active in the gold mining Jul 01,2013 The process of producing gold AngloGold Ashanti There are two types of mining which take place to access the orebody: Gold adsorbed onto activated carbon is recovered by a process of re dissolving the gold from the activated carbon (elution),followed by precipitation in electro
