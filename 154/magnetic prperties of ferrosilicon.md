Ferrosilicon Properties Applications Aug 26 2013Ferrosilicon is known to possess good resistance to abrasion good resistance to corrosion high specific gravity and high magnetism which allows easy magnetic recovery The melting point and density of ferrosilicon depends on its silicon content and it is available at a low cost Oline ChatFerro Silicon Uses 6 Surprising Ferrosilicon,29 09 2021&#0183;&#32;Due to the properties of ferrosilicon,it is used as a deoxidizer,alloy agent,desulfurizers,inoculant,nodulizer in the steel industry,foundry,the magnetic weakness is inconvenient to recover Therefore,13% 18% silicon and 87% 82% iron are suitable for use atomized ferrosilicon powder grind ferrosilicon powder.
