Concrete is recycled by using industrial crushing equipment with jaws and large impactors.After the concrete is broken up,it is usually run through a secondary impactor and is then screened to remove dirt and particles and to separate the large and small aggregate.Products Texas Aggregate and Base MaterialsCrushed concrete which has been recycled from old concrete projects is a popular and environment friendly aggregate used in a variety of civil construction projects.Recycled concrete from uncontaminated sources offers a low cost alternative to other raw material aggregates as well as being approved by TxDOT for many applications.

## Reclaimed Concrete Material
Reclaimed concrete material (RCM) is sometimes referred to as recycled concrete pavement (RCP),or crushed concrete.It consists of high quality,well graded aggregates (usually mineral aggregates),bonded by a hardened cementitious paste.The aggregates comprise approximately 60 to 75 percent of the total volume of concrete.Reclaimed Concrete Material Used as Base or Fill.RCM is most often used as aggregate in a base or subbase course.Although it is generally of high enough quality to be used as base material,RCM can also be used for lesser applications like embankment or fill material.Since RCM is a crushed material,the angular aggregates will provide excellent stiffness and load transfer capability.
