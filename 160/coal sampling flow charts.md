## The Different Types Of Sampling Plans For QC Inspections
A sampling plan allows an auditor or a researcher to study a group (e.g.a batch of products,a segment of the population) by observing only a part of that group,and to reach conclusions with a predefined level of certainty.In this article I cover these cases indepth (hit the links below to skip to the relevant section):
