## How To Calculate Quantities Of Materials For Concrete
Calculation Of Materials For Different Mix Ratio: Quantity estimation of materials is essentially required in any construction works and quantity of materials depend on the mix proportions of the concrete.In our previous article,we have already discussed how to.how many cement use for 1cum concrete for 25Grade.This means cement volume is half of stone jelly volume.To prepare 1cu.m of concrete we need 0.0 cu.m of jelly.So we need 0.9 2= 0.45 cu.m of sand.So weight of cement required = 0.45x1440 =648 kg of cement.approximately 13 bags.
