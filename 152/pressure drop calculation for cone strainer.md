## Standard Cast Pipeline Strainers
29&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The pressure loss across a strainer can be calculated using the system’s flow rate and the Cv factor for that strainer.For example,a 1&quot; Model 72 simplex strainer with a perforated basket has a Cv factor of 22.5.In water service with a 30 gpm flow rate,it will have a 1.7 psi pressure drop …Temporary Strainer1 &ensp;&#0183;&ensp;As an example,the downstream pressure should never fall below the NPSHr of a pump.Perforation size or screen size.The strainer should be slightly smaller than the smallest piece of debris that is expected to flow through it.If the perforations are too small,a high pressure drop could develop across the strainer and cause it to fail.

## How to Select a Strainer Flow Control
How to Select a Strainer.Any flow rate over 150 GPM will most likely require a basket strainer because of pressure drop considerations.Strainers are usually sized so that their start up pressure drop is no greater than 2 PSI,with a line velocity not to exceed 8 FPS.On a per size basis,basket strainers exhibit less pressure loss than Y.Estimate Clean Pressure Drop in Cone Strainer&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Estimate Clean Pressure Drop in Cone Strainer sshep (Chemical) (OP).Here is an old approximation for a clean strainer where a cone is equal to 100% of the pressure drop for same.A truncated cone is 80% of the value.Pressure Drop (psi)=.0005*P*V^2 P= density = # ft^3
