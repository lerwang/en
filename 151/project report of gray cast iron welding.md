When TIG Welding one hand is used for holding the TIG torch that produces the arc and the other hand is to add the filler metal.

grey cast iron pipe is also described in detail in the Cast Iron Pipe Research Association’s Handbook of Cast Iron Pipe for Water,Gas,Industrial and Sewer Usage (Cast Iron Pipe Research Association,1952)Iron and steelPig iron is actually a very basic form of cast iron,but it's molded only very crudely because it's typically melted down to make steel.The high carbon content of cast iron (the same as pig iron—roughly 3 4 percent) makes it extremely hard and brittle: large crystals of carbon embedded in cast iron stop the crystals of iron from moving about.

## Equivalent carbon content Wikipedia
In welding,equivalent carbon content (CE) is used to understand how the different alloying elements affect hardness of the steel being welded,When heat treating cast iron,various CE samples are tested to empirically determine the correlation between CE and hardness The following is an example for induction hardened gray irons.Difference between ms pipe and cast steel pipe,Hot dip,Difference between MS pipe and cast steel pipe Cast steel pipe is pipe with casting,cast steel pipe,cast steel pipe which is divided into centrifugal sand and metal type Material divided into gray cast steel pipe and ductile steel pipe,different materials,cast steel pipe is made of ductile iron,mild steel pipe is made of.
