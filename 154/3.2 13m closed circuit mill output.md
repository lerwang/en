HEA2&#174; is one of the most effective dispersants yet developed for use as a grinding aid pack set inhibitor for portland cement and other hydraulic cements.HEA2&#174; greatly improves the efficiency of the grinding process by reducing the surface energy forces which cause agglomeration of the newly fractured cement particles.HEA2&#174; is effective in both open circuit and closed circuit cement mills.Thermocouple Testing ProcedureCLOSED CIRCUIT LOAD This reading is taken the same as the previous reading except the burner is now on.With a proper flame,this reading should be about the same as the previous reading.With a lifting main burner flame or excessive drafts or chimney pull,this reading may reduce from previous reading (flame being pulled away from the thermocouple).

## Cement mill
Closed circuit systems.The efficiency of the early stages of grinding in a ball mill is much greater than that for formation of ultra fine particles,so ball mills operate most efficiently by making a coarse product,the fine fractions of this then being separated,and the coarse part being returned to the mill inlet.Getting more from the cement ball mill with the Fives FCB.3 Increasing the mill output The first objective when modernizing a grinding circuit by installing a high efficiency classifier is to increase the mill efficiency,with a consequent increase in mill through put.Reduction of the bypass is t
