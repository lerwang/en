## Bio Beneficiation of Australian Iron Ores Potential …
Description Iron ore currently mined in Australia generally requires very little beneficiation.However,depleting high grade resources means that in the future low grade iron ore deposits will need to be mined to meet the increasing demands of the global steel industry.Investigation of Adsorption Mechanism of Reagents …A classification of reagents for iron ore flotation and their adsorption mechanism have been summarized.• There is a strong relationship between reagents used and surface properties as well as mineralogy of ore for an efficient flotation.• The reagents to be chosen.
