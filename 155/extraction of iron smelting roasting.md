## EXTRACTION OF IRON
The process of the extraction of iron is carried out by the following steps: Concentration of ore Calcination or Roasting of ore Reduction of ore The charge is fed into the furnace from its top.A preheated blast of air at 1500 O C,is blown into the furnace under pressure near to the bottom.extraction V,Ti from magnetiteThe process is based on selective reduction smelting for the extraction of iron,soda ash roasting and leaching for the recovery of vanadium and hydrochloric acid leaching for the production of a feedstock material for the titanium chlorination process.

## Zinc smelting
Zinc smelting is the process of converting zinc concentrates (ores that contain zinc) into pure zinc.Zinc smelting has historically been more difficult than the smelting of other metals,e.g.iron,because in contrast,zinc has a low boiling point.At temperatures typically used for smelting metals,zinc is a gas that will escape from a.Principles of Extractive MetallurgyWhat is Extractive Metallurgy ? Deals with extraction of metals from its naturally existing ore minerals and refining them Minerals: Inorganic compounds with more than one metal in association with non metals like S,O,N etc.Naturally existing minerals are sulphides,oxides,halides like:.
