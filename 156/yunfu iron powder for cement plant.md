## Coal &amp; cement World Coal Association
Cement is made from a mixture of calcium carbonate (generally in the form of limestone),silica,iron oxide and alumina.A high temperature kiln,often fuelled by coal,heats the raw materials to a partial melt at 1450&#176;C,transforming them chemically and physically into a substance known as clinker.How Cement Is MadeCommon materials used to manufacture cement include limestone,shells,and chalk or marl combined with shale,clay,slate,blast furnace slag,silica sand,and iron ore.These ingredients,when heated at high temperatures form a rock like substance that is ground into the fine powder that we commonly think of as cement.
