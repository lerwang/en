## Silver Lead Zinc Ore Processing Method using Flotation
Sulphide ore of lead and zinc containing considerable silver was submitted for testing with the purpose of determining a flowsheet for the production of separate lead and zinc concentrates for marketing at their respective smelters It is necessary to recover as much silver as possible in the lead concentrate as a higher return for this silver.Silver Lead Zinc Ore Processing Method using FlotationThe ore contained sphalerite,a portion of which was easily floatable but difficult to depress in the lead flotation circuit Also,the recovery of silver minerals occurring in a lead,zinc sulfide ore is efficiently accomplished using Flowsheet #2 The process consists of selective flotation to produce a mixed silver,lead concentrate for.

One trick if your silver has a lot of base metals in it is to melt it with lead This is the best way to do electrical contacts that are silver on a tungsten sponge because you can not melt the silver off the tungsten with a torch but the lead will mix with the silver and the tungsten will float on topParkes process chemistry BritannicaOther articles where Parkes process is discussed: Alexander Parkes: This procedure,commonly called the Parkes process (patented in 1850),involves adding zinc to lead and melting the two together When stirred,the molten zinc reacts and forms compounds with any silver and gold present in the lead These zinc compounds are lighter than the lead and,on cooling,form,
