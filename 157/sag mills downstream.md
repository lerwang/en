## Mill (grinding)
SAG is an acronym for semi autogenous grinding.SAG mills are autogenous mills that also use grinding balls like a ball mill.A SAG mill is usually a primary or first stage grinder.SAG mills use a ball charge of 8 to 21%.The largest SAG mill is 42' (12.8m) in diameter,powered by a 28 MW (38,000 HP) motor.Austin SAG modelHistory.The SAG mill model by proposed by Leonard Austin (1990) was largely based on modifications of earlier tumbling mill models by Hogg &amp; Fuerstenau and F.Bond.The model uses a kinetic potential energy balance to describe the power draw of a mill charge.Many geometric components of the earlier models were fit to empirical relationships measured by Austin.
