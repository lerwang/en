## Puddling (metallurgy)
Puddling was one step in one of the most important processes of making the first appreciable volumes of high grade bar iron (malleable wrought iron) during the Industrial Revolution.In the original puddling technique,molten iron in a reverberatory furnace was stirred with rods,which were consumed in the process.It was one of the first processes for making bar iron without charcoal in Europe.mill for slag grinding 2 germanyHome mill for slag grinding 2 germany Diffusion Engineers Official Site Diffusion Engineers is the best infrastructure in industry that involves into the wide range of welding consumable,welding electrodes maintenance,manufacturers and suppliers of wear plates and components in India.
