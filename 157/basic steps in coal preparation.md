## Coal mining
Coal preparation As explained above,during the formation of coal and subsequent geologic activities,a coal seam may acquire mineral matter,veins of clay,bands of rock,and igneous intrusions.In addition,during the process of mining,a portion of the roof and floor material may be taken along with the coal seam in order to create adequate working height for the equipment and miners.Mineral ProcessingMineral Processing Coal Preparation The current courses presented at CTC are aimed at mineral processing but are also applicable to other beneficiation processes.Both the Basic and Advanced courses' Unit Standards are accredited by the MQA and are being presented under the auspices of the South African Coal Processing Society.
