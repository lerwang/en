## Stator
The stator is the stationary part of a rotary system,found in electric generators,electric motors,sirens,mud motors or biological rotors.Energy flows through a stator to or from the rotating component of the system.In an electric motor,the stator provides a rotating magnetic field that drives the rotating armature; in a generator,the stator converts the rotating mChina Wholesale Motor CrushingCircuit board recycling equipment Scope of application: It is used for separating metals and non metals in materials,such as waste circuit boards,CCL,

## Eddy currents in case of synchronous and asynchronous motors
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Eddy currents are induced in rotor body.In a synchronous motor,the rotor body is moving at synchronous speed and hence,there is no relative motion between rotor body and rotating stator magnetic field.In an asynchronous motor,rotor body is rotating slower than the stator magnetic field.Hence,there is a relative motion between the rotor body and stator magnetic flux.Thermal Analysis of Axial Flux Permanent Magnet.Rotor losses generated by induced eddy currents may amount to a major part of the total losses in high speed permanent magnet machine applications.The eddy currents are mainly induced in the permanent magnets,which are highly conductive,and in the rotor steel too (Van der Veen,et al,1997).

In a turbine,the stator element contains blades or ports used to redirect the flow of fluid.Such devices include the steam turbine and the torque converter.In a mechanical siren,the stator contains one or more rows of holes that admit air into the rotor; by controlling the flow of air through the holes,the sound of the siren can be altered.M&#233;moire de ma&#238;trise de Henry Stone Cabins solides …14 ao&#251;t 2017 M&#233;moire de ma&#238;trise de Henry Stone Cabins.Mais si la valeur de l’euro chute &#224; 1 dollar.Si l’argent change cinq fois,cinq taux de change seront utilis&#233;s dans le processus de rapprochement.

## Difference Between Stator &amp; Rotor (with Comparison chart.
Difference Between Stator &amp; Rotor The stator and rotor both are the parts of the electrical motor.The significant difference between the rotor and the stator is that the rotor is the rotating part of the motor whereas the stator is the stationary part of the motor.The other differences between the stator and rotor are shown below in the comparison chart.Rotor Eddy Current loss in permanent magnet brushless AC.WANG et al.: ROTOR EDDY CURRENT LOSS IN PERMANENT MAGNET BRUSHLESS AC MACHINES 2703 TABLE I FREQUENCIES OF FORWARD AND BACKWARD ROTATING HARMONICS is given by (10) The total eddy current loss in the th magnet segment can be obtained from (11) Using the orthogonal properties of trigonometric functions,the
