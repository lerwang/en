## how do i find the length of a roll of conveyor belt is.
2008 10 19&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;I'm assuming that the conveyor belt will go around 2 cylinders like this: o=====o.So,the belt goes around half of one cylinder and half of the other.Together,it goes around a circle.The length of a circle is pi (3.141526535) times the diameter.The rest of the length of the roll is twice the distance between the centers of the cylinder.Conveyor Calculators Superior IndustriesFind conveyor equipment calculators to help figure specs.Conveyor Lift Stockpile Volume Conveyor Horsepower Maximum Belt Capacity Idler Selector
