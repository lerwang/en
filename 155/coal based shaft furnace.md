## Direct Reduced Iron and its Production Processes IspatGuru
The gas based process uses a shaft furnace for the reduction reaction.The coal based process uses any one of the four types of reactors for the reduction reaction.These reactors are (i) rotary kiln,(ii) shaft furnace,(iii) fluidized bed reactor,and (iv) rotary hearthEIA: India’s steel industry dominated by electric based,gas based shaft furnace processes,accounting for 82% of 2016 production (728 million tonnes); and coal based rotary kiln furnaces (mainly in India),accounting for 175% of 2016 production In India there are many small rotary kiln furnaces producing DRI—known locally as sponge iron—using coal as energy and reductant source

## Copper Smelting Furnace
The early development of the reverberatory furnace for smelting copper ores was the work of the Welsh smelters,particularly those of Swansea The first record of a reverberatory furnace is made by Jars,who states that copper smelting was effected in reverberatory furnaces at Middleton Tyas,in Yorkshire,England The first patent,of any importance,for improvements in reverberatory furnaces.Blast furnace WikipediaIn a blast furnace fuel.and the shaft furnaces used in combination with sinter plants in base metals.Powdered coal; Coke oven; Coke; Blast furnace gas downcomer;
