## Studies on flocculation of fine mineral tailings using.
9&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Tailings are usually produced at some mineral processing and mine sits.In the mining,the most part of the mines are tailings whereas the extracted minerals are just small part of all fractions.After low grade ores has been utilized,almost 99% of main materials may finally become tailing.Therefore,tailings contain large part of waste in miningReal Time Dry Beach Length Monitoring for Tailings …The length of dry beach is an important factor that influences the safety of tailings dams.However,there still is no accurate and reliable method that can conveniently measure the length of dry beach.In this paper,the authors focus on developing a novel method for dry beach length determination.The proposed method can effectively measure the dry beach length through an ordinary camera and.
