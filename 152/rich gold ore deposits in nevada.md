## Gold Deposits and Their Geological Classification
20&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The development of a simple classification scheme for gold deposits,as presented here,has been approached with a full appreciation that there are many difficulties associated with classification of ore deposits in general.In the case of lode gold deposits,contrasting classifications and nomenclatures have been arrived at historically.Gold rich pyrite rims in a Carlin Au deposit: application.25&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Carlin type deposits represent one of the most important sources of gold.in the world.In over 40 years,more than 2000 metric tonnes of gold have been produced from the deposits in the Great Basin region of Nevada and Utah,USA.(Thompson,2002).The ore in these deposits typically consists of gold rich arsenian pyrite or arsenian
