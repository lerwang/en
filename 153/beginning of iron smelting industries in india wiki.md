## Ferrous metallurgy
Ferrous metallurgy is the metallurgy of iron and its alloys.It began far back in prehistory.The earliest surviving iron artifacts,from the 4th millennium BC in Egypt,[1] were made from meteoritic iron nickel.[2] It is not known when or where the smelting of iron from ores began,but by the end of the 2nd millennium BC iron was being.Iron Making Boundless World HistoryEarly iron smelting used charcoal as both the heat source and the reducing agent.By the 18th century,the availability of wood for making charcoal had limited the expansion of iron production,so England became increasingly dependent on Sweden (from the mid th century) and then from about 1725 on Russia for the iron required for industry.
