## How to Identify Basalt Sciencing
Basalt,a volcanic igneous rock,occurs worldwide,but especially in India,Scotland,Greenland,Iceland,Canada and the northwestern United States.Most basalt occurs as lava flows,in narrow dykes or sills.It's the basalt from lava flows that make up the enormous sheets of a lava plateau.This rock is easy to.Limestone Phoenix Stone2019 8 25&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Limestone.Limestone is a fine grained,sedimentary rock formed from compressed and cemented seashells and marine animal skeletons.Due to a large number of minerals in its composition,limestone can vary in colour from cream to pink to brown to black.
