## CERAMIC PROPERTIES OF PUGU KAOLIN CLAYS PART 2:,
Ceramic properties of Pugu kaolin clays Bull Chem Soc Ethiop 2004,18(1) 11 Figure 2 XRD profile of a conventional porcelain body recorded between 2 theta values of 15o and 36oThe.Ceramic properties of Pugu kaolin clays.Part I: …The utilisation of Pugu kaolin clay as a raw material in porcelain has been tested by laboratory scale experiments.Physical characteristics of the clay have shown it to be of satisfactory quality and comparable to commercial clays found elsewhere.The chemical analysis has indicated the presence of high levels of iron oxide (~ 1.43%) which could adversely affect the translucency of whitewares.
