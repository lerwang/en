## PALLET CHAIN CONVEYOR QUALIS ENGINEERS
Chain driven roller conveyors and chain conveyors are used when moving large heavy loads such as pallets,drums,bales etc.This range of conveyor can handle product up to nominally 2000kgs depending on the type and size of the load.They are also used in Chill or Cold stores where a stainless steel version is utilized which use special low temperature components.…Roller Chain Size Chart FB ChainWe manufacture roller chain to International standard ISO R606 and American Standard ANSI b 29.1,the standards are at their most basic level roller chain size charts and while a minimum tensile load is specified.Please click the chains size below to take you to a page giving you basic Roller chain dimensions.
