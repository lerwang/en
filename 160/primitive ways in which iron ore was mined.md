Earth's most important iron ore deposits are found in sedimentary rocks.They formed from chemical reactions that combined iron and oxygen in marine and fresh waters.The two most important minerals in these deposits are iron oxides hematite (Fe 2 O 3) and magnetite (Fe 3 O 4).These iron ores have been mined to produce.Live.

## What Are the Different Ways That Minerals Can Be …
Mining is the process of mineral extraction from an ore or rock seam.The minerals can range from precious metals and iron to gemstones and quartz.In ancient times,miners recognized a mineral rock formation from its outcrop at the surface.Modern mining technology uses geophysical techniques that involve measuring.Top 5 OSRS Best Places To Mine Iron GAMERS DECIDEWhat makes this location viable is the three iron rocks in a triangle formation.This is optimal for power mining.You can stand in the middle and make your way around,mining each one in a circle formation.You will never have to move from the same spot to reach all three rocks.By the time you mine all three the first one has respawned.

## primitive ways in which iron ore was mined
That Primitive People Mined Iron Ore.Iron ore was the third highest value metal mined in the United States,after gold and copper.Iron ore was mined from nine active mines and three reclamation operations in Michigan,Minnesota,and Utah.Most of the iron ore was mined in northern Minnesota's Mesabi Range.Get priceA Underground Method of Mining Iron OreFrom these ports the mining of the ore begins on the bottom of the ninth level.The first cut of this ore is mined about 8 to 10 feet high and the spaces from which the ore has been removed are filled with rock.This rock filling follows the mining and affords absolute safety and inflexible support to the walls of the mine.

## Hurstwic: Iron Production in the Viking Age
The iron ore shown to the right was excavated from Skógar,a Viking age iron making site in Iceland.The larger piece is about 2cm (less than 1in) in the long dimension.Sometime about 1000 years ago,someone gathered this iron ore,processed it,transported it to the iron smelting site,but for unknown reasons,never used it in a smelt.Iron Ore HowStuffWorksThe most primitive facility used to smelt iron is a bloomery.There,a blacksmith burns charcoal with iron ore and a good supply of oxygen (provided by a bellows or blower).Charcoal is essentially pure carbon.The carbon combines with oxygen to create carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide (releasing lots of heat in the process).Carbon and carbon.
