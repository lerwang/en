## Tire and TDF Use in Portland Cement Kilns
A cement kiln provides an environment conducive to the use of many fuel substances,such as tires,not normally included in the fuel mix.Specifically,the very hot,long,inclined rotary kiln provides temperatures up to 2700*F,long residence time,and a scrubbing action on kiln materials that allows a kiln to accommodate and destroy many problem organic substances.Cement making processSince the raw meal grinding work takes up more than 30% labor force in the whole dry process cement production line,it is quite important to choose appropriate grinding equipment and technological process so that high quality products can be obtained.

## Cement kiln
Cement kilns are used for the pyroprocessing stage of manufacture of Portland and other types of hydraulic cement,in which calcium carbonate reacts with silica bearing minerals to form a mixture of calcium silicates.Over a billion tonnes of cement are made per year,and cement kilns are the heart of this production process: their capacity.Cement grinding optimisationThe cement clinker grinding circuit reduces the feed from 80% passing size between 10 and 20 mm to 100% passing 90 μm.The size reduction takes place in a two compartment tube mill; the first compartment of the mill is shorter than the second compartment.
