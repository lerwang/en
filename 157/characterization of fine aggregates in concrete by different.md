## What is a Concrete Aggregate? (with pictures)
 · Using aggregate makes concrete much stronger,with the aggregate acting as a type of reinforcement.The aggregate increases the lifetime of the concrete,and makes it more durable.Contractors can choose from fine aggregates,made from small particles of material,and coarse aggregates,which are made with large chunks.Chemical and Mineralogical Characterization of RecycledIn this study,four samples of recycled aggregates from the construction and demolition waste of Mexico City were characterized in order to find innovative uses for these types of materials.Gravel and sand from a recycling plant were analyzed,as well as aggregates produced in the laboratory from demolished concrete collected from landfills.The characterization was carried out by means of
