## Why are there crushed stones alongside rail tracks?
This is a good question with an interesting answer.The crushed stones are what is known as ballast.Their purpose is to hold the wooden cross ties in place,which in turn hold the rails in place.Think about the engineering challenge faced by r.Vertical Stresses in Subgrades Beneath Statically Loaded.Vertical Stresses in Subgrades Beneath Statically Loaded Flexible Pavements.and dual tandem truck tire loads on flexible pavements to determine the stress distribution in the subgrade and the relative load spreading ability of different base course.in homogeneous clay as well as in a two layered mass consisting of crushed stone base
