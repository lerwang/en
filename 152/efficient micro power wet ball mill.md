## Difference Between Sag Mill vs Ball Mill
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;In ancient time,the mills were operated with muscle power (by hands),water animals and wind.They were totally based on the mechanical energy by natural resources and living beings.There are many types of mills which are used in the grinding industries.Today we will discuss about two important mill,sag mill and ball mill.Ball MillBall mills are among the most variable and effective tools when it comes to size reduction of hard,brittle or fibrous materials.The variety of grinding modes,usable volumes and available grinding tool materials make ball mills the perfect match for a vast range of applications.Feed material: medium hard,hard,brittle,fibrous dry or wet.

## Ball Mill
The High Energy Ball Mill E max and MM 500 were developed for grinding with the highest energy input.The innovative design of both,the mills and the grinding jars,allows for continuous grinding down to the nano range in the shortest amount of time with only minor warming effects.These ball mills are also suitable for mechano chemistry.Factors Affecting Ball Mill Grinding EfficiencyThe following are factors that have been investigated and applied in conventional ball milling in order to maximize grinding efficiency: a) Mill Geometry and Speed Bond (1954) observed grinding efficiency to be a function of ball mill diameter,and established empirical relationships for recommended media size and mill speed that take this factor into account.
