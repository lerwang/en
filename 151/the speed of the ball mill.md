## Ball Mill Critical Speed
A Ball Mill Critical Speed (actually ball,rod,AG or SAG) is the speed at which the centrifugal forces equal gravitational forces at the mill shell’s inside surface and no balls will fall from its position onto the shell.The imagery below helps explain what goes on inside a mill as speed varies.Use our online formula The mill speed is typically defined as the percent of the Theoretical.Ball MillsThe ball mill is a tumbling mill that uses steel balls as the grinding media.The length of the cylindrical shell is usually 1 1.5 times the shell diameter (Figure 8.11).The feed can be dry,with less than 3% moisture to minimize ball coating,or slurry containing 20 40% water by weight.
