## Mining
Magnetite ore is extracted using traditional open pit mining techniques we drill and blast,then use our excavators and haul trucks to cart the ore to our four in pit crushers.The open pit mine itself is currently over 2.5 km 2 in area and will expand during the life of the mine to more than triple this size.Perlite Mining &amp; ProcessingIn order to assure product quality,ore mining dig plans are designed on information gathered from this geological mapping and associated sample tests.The ore is crushed to minus 1 &#189;&quot; at the quarry site and stockpiled.The crushed perlite ore is loaded by.
