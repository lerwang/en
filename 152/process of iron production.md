## Steel Production
The first blast furnaces appeared in the 14th century and produced one ton per day.Even though equipment is improved and higher production rates can be achieved,the processes inside the blast furnace remain the same.The blast furnace uses coke,iron ore and limestone to produce pig iron.Coal is a key part of the coke making process.,production process of iron &amp; steel.1&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Based on the concept of iron flow diagram of steel production process,a expression of relationship between iron resource efficiencies in steel production process and unit process has been derived..

## Hydrogen production by steam iron process
The process operates two stages: during the reduction step the iron ores are reduced by synthesis or biomass gas,which is thereby oxidised to a lean gas with low remaining CO (6 8%) and H 2 (ca.6%) content.In the subsequent oxidation step,the iron ore is re oxidised by water vapour yielding an hydrogen rich fuel gas.Resources Trend and Use of Direct Reduced Iron in.27&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Resources Trend and Use of Direct Reduced Iron in Steelmaking Process Dr.Hidetoshi TANAKA ＊1 ＊1 Technology &amp; process Engineering Dept.Iron Unit Div.Engineering Business Expectations are rising for new ironmaking processes that can utilize a wide variety of materials and fuels and also are environmentally friendly.The direct reduction (DR)
