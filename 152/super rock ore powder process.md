## 4 Igneous Processes and Volcanoes An Introduction …
4.1.3 Igneous Rock Bodies.Igneous rocks are common in the geologic record,but surprisingly,it is the intrusive rocks that are more common.Extrusive rocks,because of their small crystals and glass,are less durable.Plus,they are,by definition,exposed to the elements of erosion immediately.Intrusive rocks,forming underground with larger,stronger crystals,are more likely to last.Manufacturing Process of CopperVirtually all sulfide type copper ores,including chalcocite (Cu 2 S),chalcopyrite (CuFeS 2) and covellite (CuS),are treated by smelting.After crushing the ore to a fine powder,it is concentrated by froth flotation,which requires mixing the powdered ore with reagents that …

## How Is Gold Extracted From Gold Ore? Sciencing
Gold is usually found alone or alloyed with mercury or silver,but can also be found in ores such as calaverite,sylvanite,nagyagite,petzite and krennerite.Most gold ore now comes from either open pit or underground mines.The ores sometimes contain as little as 5 100 of an ounce of gold per ton of rock…Gold Extraction &amp; Recovery Processes4&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;In mineral processing or metallurgy,the first stage of comminution is crushing.Depending of the type of rock (geometallurgy) to be crushed,there are 2 largely different techniques at your disposition for crushing rocks.In principle,compression crushing is used on hard and abrasive rocks by placing them between a high wear resistant plate surface.Less abrasive and softer rocks or stones.
