## How Is Iron Extracted From the Earth? Reference.com
Iron ores in the form of hematite (ferrous oxide) and magnetite are removed from the earth through mining.The use of heavy mining equipment is necessary to dig out large pits in an area with a large deposit of iron ore; however,because iron does not occur naturally,it is necessary to use a blast furnace to separate or refine iron from the other substances in the iron ore.Iron Ore Geoscience Australia&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Australia's iron ore reserves and resources comprise both hematite and magnetite ores.Because of the high average grades (% Fe) of hematite ores when compared to the average,unbeneficiated,grades of magnetite ores,it is necessary to report national reserves and resources in terms of contained iron as well as bulk iron ore.
