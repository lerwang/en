## Ball Mill
For ball milling,there is an optimum speed where the centrifugal force at the top of the mill is just balanced by the force of gravity.This caused the balls to be lifted to the maximum height before they fall onto the balls below,thus imparting the most kinetic energy.In practice,the ball mill is run at just below this speed (70 80%).Ball Mill Critical Speed &amp; Working Principle&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;The effect of Ball Mill RPM speed going from sub critical to super critical helps understand the Ball Mill Working Principles of ball on ball VS ball on shell grinding.The Motion of the Ball Charge
