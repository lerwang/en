## Experimental Investigation on Propagation Behavior …
Refracturing is an effective technology for reinstituting a percolation path and improving the fracture conductivity in coal measure strata.Hydraulic fracture (HF) propagation is complicated due to the presence of cleats and stress change caused by pore pressure changes.Many scholars have studied HF propagation in the initial fracturing of coal,but the refracturing in coal seams is rarely.Effect of properties of pulverized coal on dense phase.Effect of properties of pulverized coal on dense.faster than that of coarse coal and is less than that of coarse coal lately.The reason for this phenomenon is that when the pulverized coal is fully fluidized,further increasing in gas flow rate leads to decreasing in particle concentration.Also,the interaction between particles for fine
