## Is Bronze Magnetic? Reference
Bronze is not magnetic,which is due to the fact that it is an alloy composed of copper and tin,neither of which are magnetic Most metals are not magnetic,with only a few exceptions,such as iron,cobalt and nickel Although bronze is most commonly a copper tin alloy,there are a number of.C63200 Nickel Aluminum Bronze in Stock BY Busby …Busby Metals is pleased to announce that a full line of both hexes and rounds made from C63200 nickel aluminum bronze are now in stock.C63200 nickel aluminum bronze is a highly popular alloy in the marine defense industry

## Guide to Nickel Aluminium Bronze for Engineers
1&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;6 GUIDE TO NICKEL ALUMINIUM BRONZE FOR ENGINEERS Broadly,the nickel aluminium bronzes can be classified as alloys containing 13% aluminium and up to 7% iron and 7% nickel.The more common alloys normally contain 6% each of these two elements.Manganese up to approximately 1.5% is also added,both as a deoxidant and a strengthening element.Auminum Bronze text1&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;cast in nickel aluminum bronze,alloy C95800.Nickel aluminum bronze was selected for these rings,which operate under a hydrostatic head as large as 400 ft (122 m),for the alloy's proven anti galling properties and excellent galvanic corrosion resistance with respect to the austenitic stainless steel (Type 304 and Nitonic 60) rotating
