## Strength Of Cement Mortar Determine Compressive …
Mortar is a mixture of cement and sand in a specified ratio on which the strength of the mortar depends.If the mortar is weak then also its compressive strength is very low but if the mortar is a strong one then its compressive strength is also very high.The mixture of sand and cement in water is generally weak in tension and is strong in compression that is why when the concrete is.Compressive strengthCompressive strength or compression strength is the capacity of a material or structure to withstand loads tending to reduce size,as opposed to tensile strength,which withstands loads tending to elongate.In other words,compressive strength resists compression (being pushed together),whereas tensile strength resists tension (being pulled apart).
