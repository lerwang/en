## CIP 35 Testing Compressive Strength of Concrete
The compressive strength of concrete is the most common performance measure used by the engineer in designing buildings and other structures.The compressive strength is measured by breaking cylin drical concrete specimens in a compression testing machine.The compressive strength is calculated from the failure load divided by the cross sectional area resisting the load and reported in units.Relation between Compressive Strength of Baked Clay Cubes.It is to be noted that cube crushing strength of normal concrete is 20 MPa.The ratio of cylinder to cube crushing strength of baked clay is less than that of.
