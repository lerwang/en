## Mill (grinding)
A mill is a device that breaks solid materials into smaller pieces by grinding,crushing,or cutting.Such comminution is an important unit operation in many processes.There are many different types of mills and many types of materials processed in them.Historically mills were powered by hand (e.g.via a hand crank),working animal (e.g.Horizontal Grinding Mill Overflow Type,Grate discharge.Note) Capacities listed in the above table are based on tests with ores of Wi 13KWH MT with wet processing in closed circuit.A : Capacities are based on tests with grinding material of 80% and 10 mm in pass particle size to produce products of 80% and 200mm (approximately 65 mesh).

## Rod Mills
Rod Mills may be considered either fine crushers or coarse grinding equipment.They are capable of taking as large as 2″ feed and making a product as fine as 48 mesh.Of particular advantage is their adaptability to handling wet sticky ores,which normally would.Modelling the processing of gasifier feedPerformance evaluation of the rod mill The macro parameter to understand the performance of the rod mill is F80 and P80 (particle diameter which is larger than 80% of the inlet outlet mass).The other parameters are the power input to the rod mill which in turn is closely rela

## Grinding Mills and Their Types IspatGuru
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Grinding mills are size reductions machines that often follow crushers in the processes where finer products are desired after crushing.Different grinding machines are usually named as mills,for example rod mills,ball mills,and attrition mills.Because of the name,Mill ChargeThe height (or depth) of charge is measured in the same manner as for ball mill.The size of feed particles to a rod mill is coarser than for a ball mill.The usual feed size ranges from 6 to 25 mm.For the efficient use of rods it is necessary that they operate parallel to the central axis
