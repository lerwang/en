## Vitrification of municipal solid waste incineration fly.
In this paper,B 2 O 3 was used as a fluxing agent to reduce the melting temperature of municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) fly ash and promote the glassy phase formation.Ash fusion temperature (AFT) test,atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS),X ray diffraction(XRD),scanning electron microscope (SEM) and thermodynamic calculation were carried out.Slag Cement QuestionsSlag cement concrete sometimes turns green for a short period of time due to the oxidation state of sulfide sulphur compounds during portland slag cement hydration.This is normally a temporary condition and the concrete,upon exposure to air and sunlight,will ultimately become lighter than 100% portland cement concrete.
