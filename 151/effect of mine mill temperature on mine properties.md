## Strontium (Sr) Chemical properties,Health and.
Strontium.Strontium is a soft,silver yellow,alkaline earth metal.It has three allotropic crystalline forms and in its physical and chemical properties it is similar to calcium and barium.Strontium reacts vigorously with water and quickly tarnishes in air,so it must be stored out of contact with air and water.Grasberg mine WikipediaThe Grasberg mine is the largest gold mine and the second largest copper mine in the world.It is located in the province of Papua in Indonesia near Puncak Jaya,the highest mountain in Papua.It has 19,500 employees.It is mostly owned by Freeport McMoRan (FCX),which owns 48.74% of PT Freeport Indonesia (PT FI),the principal operating subsidiary in Indonesia,including 9.36% owned through.
