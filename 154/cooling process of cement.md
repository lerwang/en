## CLINKER COOLING TECHNOLOGY Mechanical engineering,
Clinker cooling is necessary because 1 Hot clinker is difficult to convey 2 Hot clinker has a negative effect on the grinding process 3 Reclaimed heat content of the hot clinker is an important factor in lowering the production cost 4 Proper cooling improves the quality of cementThe impact of cooling water types on the cement clinker,Sep 01,2018&#0183;&#32;The chemical and physical analysis for kiln feed was done before burning process at the kiln While the analysis and measurements related to clinker and cement were done after burning process and exposing the clinker samples for all kinds of water It was happened by sudden cooling for the clinker samples under kiln directly at the same time
