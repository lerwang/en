## Processing Is Key Element in US Rare Earth Woes Rare Earths
11 Jun 2013.China controls 95 percent of the world&#39;s rare earth supply.The key to this monopoly isn&#39;t an abundance of rare earth deposits,but its expertise in processing ore into oxides and pure metal.The ore tends to carry uranium and thorium,the most radioactive element on the planet,and extracting the metal is&nbsp;.A review of the beneficiation of rare earth element. Ecotricity NZbase of REE beneficiation must be increased (Chen,2011).This paper explores the current physical beneficiation of rare earth element bearing minerals with regard to the minerals pro cessed,the unit operations employed,some processes currently utilized at the major rare earth mines and processing plants and fi .
