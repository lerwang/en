## Stainless Steel Metal Casting Resources
Mill scale is usually removed through chemical means like electro cleaning and pickling In pickling,the stainless steel is submerged in a bath of nitric hydrofluoric ac Electro cleaning makes use of a cathode and phosphoric acid to pass a current onto the stainless steel surfaceCLEANING AND DESCALING STAINLESS STEELSsteel products received from the producing mill have been pickled,descaling is required only as a result of subsequent manufacturing operations.In evaluating the different methods for removing scale,it is well to keep in mind that scale on stainless steel is far more complex than scale formed on plain mild steel.
