## Coal liquefaction
Friedrich Bergius,also a German chemist,invented direct coal liquefaction (DCL) as a way to convert lignite into synthetic oil in 1913.Coal liquefaction was an important part of Adolf Hitler's four year plan of 1936,and became an integral part of German industry.Biomass for energy in developing countries SpringerLinkBiomass,like fossil fuels,can provide cooking and heating energy,electricity,chemicals and liquid fuels.Today about 14% of the worldwide primary energy supply is provided by biomass resources — equivalent to 1000 million tons oil each year.Most of this biomass use occurs in rural areas of developing countries where half the world's population lives.For example Kenya derives about 75%.
