## Granite: Igneous Rock
What is Granite? Granite is a light colored igneous rock with grains large enough to be visible with the unaided eye.It forms from the slow crystallization of magma below Earth's surface.Granite is composed mainly of quartz and feldspar with minor amounts of mica,amphiboles,and other minerals.This mineral composition usually gives granite a red,pink,gray,or white color with dark mineral.flow chart of granite quarry processing in malaysiabeneficiation screening flow chart.Diamond Processing Flow Chart of Beneficiation This is a Diamond Processing Chart as it was done in the 1950s World demand and production of diamond both for gem and industrial purposes has increased nearly fivefold during the past 25 years.More Details

## Metamorphic Rock Classification Table
30&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Most metamorphic rocks form during regional metamorphism,where whole sectors of the crust are pressurized and heated,forcing large volumes of rock to recrystallize into new minerals that are stable under the new conditions.As a result,rocks are changed into metamorphic rock across a region that may be many miles wide.Igneous Rock Identification Chart Mineralogy4KidsIgneous Rock Identification Chart; Igneous Rock Identification Chart.The color of an igneous rock is related to the colors of the minerals present.Rocks that are rich in silica usually contain considerable quartz and light colored feldspar.Rocks rich in magnesium (Mg) and iron (Fe) tend to contain olivine,pyroxene,amphibole,and biotite.

## Igneous Rocks: Everything You Need to Know
There are three great categories of rocks: igneous,sedimentary,and metamorphic.Most of the time,they're simple to tell apart.They are all connected in the endless rock cycle,moving from one form to another and changing shape,texture,and even chemical composition along the way.Granite12&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Granite ( ˈɡr&#230;nɪt ) is a common type of felsic intrusive igneous rock that is granular and phaneritic in texture.Granites can be predominantly white,pink,or gray in color,depending on their mineralogy.The word &quot;granite&quot; comes from the Latin granum,a grain,in reference to the coarse grained structure of such a completely crystalline.

What are the layers of the Earth? The Earth is made of four layers.Let’s start from the outside and move our way in.The top layer,which is what we stand on is the crust,next comes the mantle and finally the core.Some of these layers are made up of even more layers and they’re always on the move.The Earth is mostly made of rock and metal.Kids Love RocksIgneous Rocks.Igneous rocks are formed from melted rock that has cooled and solidified.When rocks are buried deep within the Earth,they melt because of the high pressure and temperature; the molten rock (called magma) can then flow upward or even be erupted from a volcano onto the Earth's surface.
