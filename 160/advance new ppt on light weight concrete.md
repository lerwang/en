## Lightweight concrete
Concrete is considered to be lightweight is the density is not more than 2200kg m 3 (the density of normal weight concrete is assumed to be between 2300kg m 3 and 2400kg m 3) and a proportion of the aggregate should have a density of less than 2000kg m 3.Lightweight concrete …Lightweight Structures12&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;With lightweight structures the engineer is able to award the adequate visual expression to an ingenious and efficient structure thus contributing to building culture.When we combine some of the earlier figures an order of all structures light weight and “massive”
