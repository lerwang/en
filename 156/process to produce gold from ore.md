## Pretreatment Process on Refractory Gold Ores with As
1.Introduction.Gold ores are considered refractory if gold extractions from a conventional cyanidation process are less than 80% even after fine grinding.1) Arsenic bearing refractory gold ore has stones extremely difficult to deal with.In the stones,gold is locked up in arsenic mineral matrix as the form of microscopic or submicroscopic lattice.Production of Gold1&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;of high grade ore per year for 8 years.The deposit contains 0.12 ounces of gold per ton of high grade ore and can be acquired at a cost of $10 per ton of ore (cost of mining ore at site).A sodium cyanide process is used to extract the gold from the ore,and various other processing techniques are used to produce 99.9% pure gold bullion from.

## Gold Extraction &amp; Recovery Processes
2&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Of all the methods of extracting gold &amp; processing it from its ore,I used a few to evaluate two principal flowsheets in this case study.The flowsheets utilized operations that involved flotation,cyanidation and gravity concentration.Tests that mirror each of these unit operations were utilized to evaluate the principal flowsheets.This page offers a comparative review of gold recovery.How Is Gold Purified? SciencingAccording to Hoover and Strong,a refiner and manufacturer of precious metals,they produce 98 percent pure gold using the Miller process.After a sample of treated impure gold has been tested in a lab for purity,the gold is melted in a furnace,then chlorine is bubbled through the liquid.
