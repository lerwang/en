## Specific Gravity Of General Materials Table
The specific gravity of all other materials are compared to water as a fraction heavier or fraction lighter density,no matter how small or large the fraction is For example,ammonium nitrate has a specific gravity (sg) of 073 while dry ammonium sulphate has a sg of 113 (1130 kilograms cubic meter)Garnet Northern Filter MediaAlmandite garnet is a high hardness,high density granular filter media It can be used extremely effectively as the lower strata in a dual media filter bed Its high specific gravity as well as its chemical and abrasive resistance makes almandite garnet ideal for filtration An effective multi media filter system will utilize larger sized media.

Our specific gravity is 3.0.I agree with you.M076 can look in tables of swell shrink on variouis materials from bank to in truck to in place.I have a chart but how to putMECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF BASALT AGGREGATES UNDER THE …Basalt is a stiff,durable,grey and black colored volcanic rock and it is commonly available in nature and spread over different localities in Turkey.Basalt can be used in many industrial applications such as: rock wool,pipes,moulds,and as construction materials.

## Solids and Metals Specific Gravities
The Specific Gravity SG is a dimensionless unit defined as the ratio of density of the material to the density of water at a specified temperature It is common to use the density of water at 4 o C (39 o F) as reference at this point the density of water is at the highest Specific gravities SG for common solids and metals can be found in the table below:density of crushed hornfels basalt granite india crusherSpecific Gravity Of General Materials Table CSGNetwork Pure water at 4 C (the maximum density) was chosen as the Basalt,broken,1954 Gneiss,bed in place,2867 Granite,broken,1650.&#187; Chat Online OR GO TO &#187; Feedback Form
