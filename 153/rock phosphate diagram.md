## Phosphorus Fertilizer Production and Technology
The most common raw material \ used in commercial P fertilizer production is PR which contains a calcium phosphate minera\൬ called apatite.Phosphate rock is produced in several countries.There are two main types of PR deposits: sedimentaryHow phosphate is mined and processedshown in this second diagram.Phosphorus in rock is pretty insoluble and thus not directly available to plants.In nature,rock phosphate can become soluble (and available to plants) either by chemical weathering or through the actions of certain types of plants.
