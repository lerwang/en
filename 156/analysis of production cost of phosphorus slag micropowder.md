## Phosphorus
Phosphorus is a chemical element with the symbol P and atomic number 15.Elemental phosphorus exists in two major forms,white phosphorus and red phosphorus,but because it is highly reactive,phosphorus is never found as a free element on Earth.It has a concentration in the Earth's crust of about one gram per kilogram (compare copper at.A review of phosphorus recovery methods at various steps …1.Introduction Phosphorus is increasingly recognized as a strategic raw material.The main reason for this is the growing world population.It is estimated that in the middle of this century our population will exceed 9 billion,which means that food production will have.
