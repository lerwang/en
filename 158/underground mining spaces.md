## How Underground Mining Works HowStuffWorks
Underground mines are the alternative to surface mines.Surface mines excavate from the top down,a method that can become inefficient at depths greater than about 200 feet (60 meters) [sources: Illinois Coal Association,De Beers].Undergrounds coal mines can drive 2,500 feet (750 meters) into the Earth and other types even deeper uranium mines can reach 6,500 feet,or 2 kilometers.Underground Mining2019 11 19&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Solution: The facility managers reached out to Specialized Storage Solutions and we spoke over the phone to assess their needs and come up with a conceptual drawing.

Underground all mining machinery and safety shields are operated hydraulically.A hydraulic circuit can extend up to several kilometres and is operated with up to 350 bars in the feed line.The hydraulic fluid must be free of particles in every part of the circuit.Pollution of hydraulic fluids leads to lengthy and extremely costly failures.Specific and NonSpecific Hazards in Underground MinesThe Gleision Colliery tragedy reminds us of how dangerous mining jobs can be and how specifically hazardous underground mining remains.Fire,flood,collapse,toxic atmospheric contaminants,and dust or gas explosion are the most critical hazards specifically linked to underground mining.Blasting related hazards must also be added to that list.

## Water
Before underground mining began on the Butte Hill and in the Summit Valley,Butte’s groundwater system contained groundwater from two sources: bedrock (hard rock) and alluvium (sandy gravel near the earth’s surface and below the soil layer).Water found in bedrock collects in naturally occurring fractures and spaces between the hard rocks.
