## Fineness modulus
The Fineness Modulus (FM) is an empirical figure obtained by adding the total percentage of the sample of an aggregate retained on each of a specified series of sieves,and dividing the sum by 100.The sieve sizes are 0.15 mm,0.3 mm,0.6 mm,1.18 mm,2.36 mmSOUTH AFRICAN NATIONAL STANDARD SABSSOUTH AFRICAN NATIONAL STANDARD,Computation of soil mortar percentages,coarse sand ratio,grading modulus and fineness modulus Published by SABS Standards Division 1 Dr Lategan Road Groenkloof Private Bag X191 Pretoria 0001,and fineness modulus 1 Scope This standard describes the calculation of various,
