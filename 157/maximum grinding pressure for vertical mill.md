## Grinding pressure in vertical roller mill
May 15,2013&#183; Grinding theory of vertical roller millGrinding in roller mill is effected by shear and compaction.The effective grinding In the mill depends on many parameters.Important among them area : the gripping angle,nip angle,maximum grinding pressure,grinding bed thickness between theGrinding surfaces,rolling friction factor.Polysius Roller Mills.For grindingWhen the mill is starting and stopping,the grinding force is reduced by lowering the hydraulic pressure.Each hydraulic cylinder is connected to a piston accumulator which absorbs the grinding shocks.Drive The roller mill drive consists of the motor and a planetary gear unit that was specially designed for roller mills.This gear unit is.
