## Ball Milling
Ball milling is suggested as a novel method for enhancing filler dispersion in different matrices that is environmentally and economically sustainable [85].It is a solid state mixing of powders,usually performed with ball mills,which enables intimate mixing of theSolventless Synthesis of N Protected Amino Acids in a Ball.An eco friendly methodology for preparing carbamate N protected α amino acids is described using ball milling technology.Some β amino acids were also investigated in this study.This solvent free methodology gave Boc ,Z ,and Fmoc N protected compounds in good to excellent yields with improved environmental impact compared to classical syntheses in solution.
