## The Transformation of Bauxite to Aluminum (and the.
The Bayer process is not easily explained in brief.This method of obtaining alumina from bauxite ore is complex and involves a lengthy succession of chemical reactions,with the process varying slightly depending on the makeup of the unique source of bauxite ore.Aluminium production processThe ore is loaded into autoclaves and treated with lime caustic soda.Aluminium oxide appears in the resulting slurry while all the admixtures settle to the bottom as red mud.The sodium aluminate solution is stirred in precipitators for several days,eventually pure alumina or Al 2 O 3 settles at the bottom.REDUCTION PROCESS.

## Bauxite
The process involves simply re melting the metal,which is far less expensive and energy intensive than creating new aluminium through the electrolysis of aluminium oxide ( 2 3 ),which must first be mined from bauxite ore and then refined using the Bayer process.How Is Bauxite Formed? Reference.comBauxite ore is formed when the surrounding soil or rock is dissolved by natural weathering processes until it forms a new type of rock that is usually rich in aluminum ore.Though both types are used for aluminum production,the most valuable type of bauxite ore is lateritic ore.
