## Water Quantity for 1m&#179; M25 Concrete Water Cement …
20&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;In this civil engineering article,the calculation is done to determine the quantity of water for M25 grade of concrete.Here,the volume of concrete is taken as 1m 3.Initially,it is required to find out the quantity of cement for 1m 3 concrete with m25 grade: .For 1m 3 concrete,the quantity of cement required = 9.51 bags.As we know,1 bag of cement is equivalent to 50 kgCalculate Quantities of Materials for Concrete …2 &ensp;&#0183;&ensp;C = Mass of cement.Fa = Mass of fine aggregates.Ca = Mass of coarse aggregates.S c,S fa and S ca are the specific gravities of cement,fine aggregates and coarse aggregates respectively.The air content has been ignored in this calculation.This method of calculation for quantities of materials for concrete takes into account the mix proportions from design mix or nominal mixes for.

## Concrete Mix Design Different Grades of Concrete
2 &ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Concrete is a composite mixture which consists of Cement,Sand and Aggregate.Concrete mix design is the procedure for finding the right quantities of these materials to achieve the desired strength.Accurate concrete mix design makes concrete construction economical.Large constructions such as Bridges,dams requires huge amount of concrete.How to Calculate Cement,Sand and Coarse Aggregate.2&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;For Cement,Sand and Coarse Aggregate.This is a Volumetric Calculation.Assuming we need 2 m 3 of concrete for M20 Concrete Mix,(Mix Ratio,M20 = 1 : 1.5 : 3) Total Part of the Concrete = 1+1.5+3 = 5.5 Parts.Therefore,Cement Quantity = (Cement Part Concrete Parts ) * Concrete Volume

what is water cement ratio m10,m15,m20,m25,m30,m35m,m40.Answer yogesh Generally the water cencement ratio varies from 0.4 to 0.8,It depends on grade of concrete as the grade of concrete increases w c ratio bcome less.Civiconcepts7&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;(Note 1: For every &#177;0.05 increase or decrease change in w c,the coarse aggregate proportion is to be changed by 0.01.If the w c is less than 0.5,volume of coarse aggregate is required to be increased to reduce the fine aggregate content in mix.If water cement ratio is more than 0.5,volume of coarse aggregate is to be reduced to increase the fine aggregate content.
