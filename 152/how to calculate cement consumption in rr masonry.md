## Calculate cement sand and aggregate Civil RnD
Following is a simple method used by engineers to calculate cement,sand and aggregate to produce different grade of concrete like M5,M75,M10,M15 and M20 if you don’t want to learn the math involved in the design,you can use the table given at the end of the article to produce different grade of concreteHow Many Bags of Cement Are in a Cubic Yard? …While no one knows exactly how long cement has been around,historians are certain that the Romans have been using it in large scale construction for millennia.Cement isn't a building material in and of itself; it's actually more of a binder or &quot;glue&quot; used to stick other materials together to create concrete.

1&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Density of cement = 1440 kg.The reason to multiply this density is,the above multiplication will give us only required amount of cement quantity in brickwork as a cubic metre.But we need cement in Kg.Therefore we are multiplying the 1440 kg density of cement to calculate the cement quantity.Unit Weight of Materials Used at Construction SiteFollowing table shows unit weight of materials used at construction site.Please note this is for reference purpose only and may vary from place and type of material.We are thankful to Engineer Ravi Verma for submitting this very useful information to us.If you also have any other formula and shortcuts which can be used on construction site.
