5&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Iron is the backbone of the world we have built around us and it is the basic ingredient of steel (iron plus carbon).Iron is a very useful metal because it can be mixed with other metals to make a whole variety of 'alloys' which are even stronger and don't rust easily and can be shaped into products from cars to pins,household appliances to buildings,bridges to railways,food cans to tools.Iron Ore Trading Overview: These Are The Top 4 …Why is Iron Ore Valuable? Iron ore is a rock from which the metal iron is extracted.About 98% of the world’s iron is used to produce steel.Pure iron is an element and a soft grayish white metal.Other than meteorites that fall from the sky,iron is never found by itself in nature.

## Iron Ore HowStuffWorks
In a bloomery,the fire doesn't get hot enough to melt the iron completely.Instead,the iron heats up into a spongy mass containing iron and silicates from the ore.Heating and hammering this mass (called the bloom) forces impurities out and mixes the glassy silicates into the iron metal to create wrought iron.Wrought iron is hardy and easy to work,making it perfect for creating tools.What Is the Origin of Iron? SciencingThose atoms then begin to turn into iron atoms,the heaviest type of atom a star can produce.When most of a star's atoms become iron atoms,it becomes what is known as a supernova.It explodes,showering space with iron,oxygen and carbon atoms far and wide.
