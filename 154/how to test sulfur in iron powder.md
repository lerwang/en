## Make a Mixture and a Compound from Iron and Sulfur
First form a mixture.Stir some iron filings and sulfur together to form a powder.You have just taken two elements and combined them to form a mixture.You can separate the components of the mixture by stirring the powder with a magnet; the iron filings will stick to.How would you separate sulphur from a mixture of iron …To seperate Iron and Sulphur from the mixture by physical means.Do this by wrapping the end of a small bar magnet in a paper tissue or cling film,and dipping it into a teaspoon sized heap of the mixture on a watch glass.The iron will be attracted,but the sulfur remains on the watch glass.

Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted.We use latest instrumental methods to test and analyze minerals.Instruments such as the XRF,ICP,AAS,Calorie Meter,Carbon Hydrogen Nitrogen Sulphur meter,ThermoDesulfurization of steel [SubsTech]Sulfur (S) may dissolve in liquid iron (Fe) at any concentration.However solubility of sulfur in solid iron is limited: 0.002% in α iron at room temperature and 0.013% in γ iron at 1832 F (1000 C).When a liquid steel cools down and solidifies the solubility of sulfur drops and it is liberated from the solution in form of iron sulfide (FeS) forming an eutectic with the surrounding iron.
