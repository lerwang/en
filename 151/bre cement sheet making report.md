## Heritage House Making a hot lime mortar
Recently there has been a lot of hype about NHL lime.Or to give it a name,Natural Hydraulic Lime Mortar.As Chartered Surveyors,we will only recommend hot lime mortars these days.The reason for this is a little complex chemically,but it's lost in the mists of time.This is how lime used to be made.You took limestone,burned it,added water,and mixed sand with it to make mortar.Concrete Mix Design Stonemont SolutionsStonemontQC includes a powerful concrete mix design and quality control software program for concrete producers.StonemontQC is fully integrated with the aggregate portion allowing for mix component properties to be easily kept current with data from aggregate plants.Our desktop,server,enterprise,and hosted software solutions easily scale.
