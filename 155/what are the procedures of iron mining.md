## Mining
Mining is the extraction of valuable minerals or other geological materials from the Earth,usually from an ore body,lode,vein,seam,reef or placer deposit.These deposits form a mineralized package that is of economic interest to the miner.Ores recovered by mining include metals,coal,oil shale,gemstones,limestone,chalk,dimension.What's the process of iron ore mining?Mining iron ore begins at ground level.Taconite is identified by diamond drilling core samples on a grid hundreds of feet into the earth.Taconite rock comprises about 28 percent iron; the rest is sand or silica.These samples are analyzed and ca.
