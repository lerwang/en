## Waste Mine Tailings Characterisation
27&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Waste Mine Tailings Characterisation.During the period 1977,metal ore mining was conducted in 28 states 10 east of the Mississippi River,17 west of the Mississippi River,and Alaska Non metal mineral mining is ubiquitous,occurring in all 50 states.Table 7 presents a summary of the quantities of metal ore and non metal mineral.Tailings1&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Tailings are the materials left over after the process of separating the valuable fraction from the uneconomic fraction of an ore.Tailings are distinct from overburden,which is the waste rock or other material that overlies an ore or mineral body and is displaced during mining without being processed.The extraction of minerals from ore can be done two ways: placer mining,which uses water.

## Base Metal and Iron Ore Mining
tailings from processing,is one of the main pol lution concerns in the mining industry.Removal of overburden to access the ore can pose major problems in storage and reclamation.The over burden (waste to ore) ratio for surface mining of metal ores generally ranges from 2:1 to 8:1,de pending on local conditions.The ratio for solidTailings managementMetso Tailings Management brings a comprehensive approach by combining 3 practices: Dewatering the tailings,handling them with dry stacking,and reprocessing new and existing ones.We also look to elevate the approach to reduce social hazards and associated risks,which will improve the overall image of the mining industry.

## Lecture 4: Mining waste
The amount of tailings that remain is controlled by what grade the ore is,meaning the percentage of valuable minerals in the ore.For example,if the grade of an ore is 1 percent copper,99 percent of the total ore would be deposited as tailings.Iron ores generally have higher grades than sulphide or gold ores,often going over 50 per cent or.Mining Water for allMining produces mainly tailings (the waste materials left after the valuable ore is separated out) and overburden (the waste materials removed to reach the ore).During the mining process,water within and around the mine is usually contaminated,so treating the mine water before it is discharged back into the environment is a major issue [2].
