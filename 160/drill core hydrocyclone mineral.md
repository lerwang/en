The way data are to be recorded influences in a significant way the amount and type of data that are observed.The “medium is the message”,as Marshall McCluhan famously pointed out in 1964.Using the most appropriate system for recording geological observations of drill core is therefore very important.Although a huge number of different logging forms are used in industry (almost every.Drill Core Sampling Metallurgist & Mineral Processing.The advantages of obtaining core samples that provide a visual record of the rocks and ores sampled and at the same time furnish samples for assay have been pointed out under the caption Exploration by Drilling.The diamond drill,which employs either carbons or bort as cutting media,has been the type of core drill most widely employed in metal mining,largely because it will cut the hardest.
