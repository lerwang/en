## 20.1 Metal Deposits Physical Geology opentextbc.ca
The important ore minerals include chalcopyrite (CuFeS 2),bornite (Cu 5 FeS 4),and pyrite in copper porphyry deposits,or molybdenite (MoS 2) and pyrite in molybdenum porphyry deposits.Gold is present as minute flakes of native gold.USGS Minerals Information: CopperCopper is usually found in nature in association with sulfur.Pure copper metal is generally produced from a multistage process,beginning with the mining and concentrating of low grade ores containing copper sulfide minerals,and followed by smelting and electrolytic refining to produce a pure copper cathode.
