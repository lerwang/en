## Sieve analysis
18&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Sieve analysis has,in general,been used for decades to monitor material quality based on particle size.For coarse material,sizes that range down to #100 mesh (150μm),a sieve analysis and particle size distribution is accurate and consistent.However,for material that is finer than 100 mesh,dry sieving can be significantly less accurate.Storage limits7&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Minimum size.RAID DP: 5 disks.RAID4: 3 disks.Model dependent: For root aggregates,the minimum size is 3 disks for RAID DP and 2 disks for RAID4.If you need a smaller non root aggregate,you can use the force small aggregate option.See the Hardware Universe for the minimum aggregate size for RAID0.RAID groups.Maximum per aggregate.
