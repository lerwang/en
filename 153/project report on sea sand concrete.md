## PROJECT REPORT ON PRECAST CONCRETE PRODUCTS
The concrete commonly used to make concrete blocks is a mixture of powdered portland cement,water,sand,and gravel This produces a light gray block with a fine surface texture and a high compressive strength A typical concrete block weighs 38 43 lb (172 195 kg) InWhy is sea sand not used for construction purposes? How …Sand (primarily silica) is used in construction as a component in various materials like concrete,mortar etc.Definitely the salts adsorbed (dissolution might not actually occur) on sand are going to affect the durability in reinforced concrete.
