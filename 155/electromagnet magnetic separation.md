## Magnetic Separation
The magnetic separator consists of a large electromagnet through which mineral mixtures can be passed on a metal trough which is divided near its exit end.Varying the strength of the magnetic field and or slope of the separation trough is used to separate(PDF) Electromagnet Separator of Different ParticlesThe aim of this application is to recover the particles of non ferrous and ferrous from mixture by attractive magnetic force with big rate of separation.Experiments’ results and simulation of.

## Electro Overbelt Magnet
Overbelt Electromagnet are engineered to provide ferrous metal separation performance.If your application requires increased suspension heights for the magnet or have a deep product burden,the suspended electromagnet is an ideal solution due to its deep reaching magnetic field.Magnetic Separation an overview ScienceDirect TopicsIn order to generate sufficiently high magnetic field,exceeding 1T,in a large volume,an electromagnet must be used.If the separation process requires a magnetic field less than 2T,in a relatively small volume,an ironcore electromagnet is a good choice.For the field of 2T or less,in a large volume,a watercooled ironclad solenoid
