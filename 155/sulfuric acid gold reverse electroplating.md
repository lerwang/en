Reverse Electroplating for Gold Recovery eHow Gold is typically thought of as a metal used for coins and jewelry,2012 hi can anyone help me I wonder if it will go at making sama thing with silver as with gold in sulfuric acid cell and how to do so,what kind of liquid should be used and what should I use as catod and anode Get.Electroplating Process StepsFor copper plating,two types of electrolytic baths are used.In an acid type bath,the solution is made of 150 200 gm of copper sulfate and 25 35 gm of sulfuric acid per 1000 cc of solution.Deposit obtained is thick and rough requiring polishing.In cyanide bath,solution is made of 25 gm of copper cyanide,28 gm of sodium cyanide,6 gm of sodium carbonate and 6 gm of sodium bisulfate.

## Can gold be dissolved in sulphuric acid alone? Iodine?
Decem A.Sulfuric acid can dissolve gold,but it is a very dangerous process as the sulfuric acid has to be concentrated and heated to the point sulfur dioxide gas is fumed off,silver or gold will dissolve gold will form a gold persulfate soluble in the very concentrated acid,upon dilution the gold will precipitate out of solution as a powder which can be washed and refined.Reverse Electroplating Guide For Gold RecoveryWhen reverse electroplating gold,items are placed into a one chemical electrolyte,or drain opener containing concentrated sulfuric acid,which is,
