## Effect of Feed Rock Size Distribution on Crusher Performance
20191111&ensp&#0183&enspIf the ore feed to any gyratory or jaw crusher consisted entirely of large cubes or spheres of a size that would just barely enter the crushing chamber,the crusher could not be expected to produce anything like its normal rated capacity because the upper part of the crusher could not shatter the large pieces enough to keep the rest of the crushing chamber busy.What is a Cone Crusher? TelsmithGradations and capacities are most often based on a typical,well graded choke feed to the crusher.A choke feed is when the crusher cavity is kept full,without spilling out over the top of the crusher.A minimal feed is when the crusher cavity is kept fa
