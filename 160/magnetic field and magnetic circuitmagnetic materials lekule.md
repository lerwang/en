## Magnetic Field Shielding
A magnetic field exists in any place of the Earth.It includes the weak geomagnetic field and the high intensity field generated by high power equipment,electronic devices,and power transmissions.The magnetic field will disturb sensitive electrical and high‐accuracy electronic sensors,or even cause possible health hazards for humans.Magnetic fields in materials,B and H the truth at last.2017 8 8&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Magnetic fields in materials,B and H the truth at last.Contents FIELDS 1) How not to teach it.magnetic materials are the most difficult since the magnetisation is determined not only by.magnetic field at that dipole due to other sources.In free space we only need one field.

## jaw crusher stone used in the building,factory on.
30 In mining,building materials,infrastructure and other sectors,jaw crusher is mainly used as primary crusher and secondary crusher.According to the input size,crushing equipment can be divided into large,medium and small three kinds.the input size greater than 600MM for large machines,feed mouth width in 600MM for medium.Magnetic Fields an overview ScienceDirect Topics201083&ensp&#0183&enspMagnetic fields are produced due to the movement of electrical charge and they are present around permanent magnets and current carrying conductors (magnetic circuit) as shown in Figure 11.1.In permanent magnets,revolving electrons produce an external field.If a current carrying conductor is wounded to form a coil of multiturns,the magnetic field is stronger than that of a single conductor.
