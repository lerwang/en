## (PDF) Separation of Phenolic Compounds from Coal Tar
Coal tar is a liquid by product of the process of coal gasification and carbonation.This liquid oil mixture contains various kinds of useful compounds such as aromatic compounds and phenolic.Value added utilization of high temperature coal tar: A,15 05 2021&#0183;&#32;High temperature coal tar (HTCT) is an important raw material for obtaining value added aromatics However,effective utilization of HTCT is not optimistic because of backward processing technology and higher energy consumption,resulting in fewer product types and lower purity
