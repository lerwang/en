## Pennsylvania
Pennsylvania has also been a major producer of such nonmetallic minerals as limestone,slate,sand,and gravel.Small iron ore deposits provided the basis of early iron furnaces,but the major deposits of iron ore that were located in Cornwall and Morgantown have since been abandoned.Different Types of Iron OreIron formation consists of iron ore such as siderite,magnetite,and hematite,with silica in the form of chert,jasper,etc.generally in bands,but sometimes not distinctly so.The bands of iron ore are at times high grade,but are often mixed with a good deal of silica,the whole making an ore too lean for use without concentration.
