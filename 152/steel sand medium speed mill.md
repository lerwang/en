## Cutting Speeds &amp; RPM Calculations
Cutting speed is the speed at the outside edge of the tool as it is cutting.This is also known as surface speed.Surface speed,surface footage,and surface area are all directly related.If two tools of different sizes are turning at the same revolutions per minute (RPM),the larger tool has a greater surface speed.
