## What Is the Difference Between "ferric" and "ferrous,
The difference between ferric and ferrous iron is that ferric iron is in a plus 3 oxidation state,while ferrous iron is in a plus 2 oxidation state This means that ferric iron needs to share three electrons with an oxygen molecule to make the ion neutral,while ferrous iron only needs two more electronsFerrous Sulfate Oral : Uses,Side Effects,Interactions,Severe or chronic ferrous sulfate poisonings may damage blood vessels Large chronic doses cause rickets in infants,Whatever cannot be saved for recovery or recycling should be managed in an appropriate and approved waste disposal facility Processing,use or contamination of this product may change the waste management options.

Ferrous fumarate is a type of iron You normally get iron from the foods you eat In your body,iron becomes a part of your hemoglobin (HEEM o glo bin) and myoglobin (MY o glo bin) Hemoglobin carries oxygen through your blood to tissues and organs Myoglobin helps your muscle cells store oxygen.Ferrous sulfate FeO4SFerrous sulfate appears as a greenish or yellow brown crystalline solid.Density 15.0 lb gal.Melts at 64&#176;C and loses the seven waters of hydration at 90&#176;C.The primary hazard is the threat to the environment.Immediate steps should be taken to limit its spread to the environment.Used for water or sewage treatment,as a fertilizer ingredient.
