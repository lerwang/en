## Study on Block Electrode Discharge Grinding of Micro …
Block electrode discharge grinding is an effective approach to produce micro rods.However,it is difficult to fabricate the rods into desired miniature and precision.To solve this problem,the tangential feeding method is proposed to control the finish size of micro rods.With this method,the micro rod is first fed in its radial direction,and then in the tangential direction for an enough.Effects of Machining Parameters on.Electrical Discharge Surface Grinding (EDSG) is much like electrical discharge machining except that the electrode is a rotating metal matrix composite (MMC) tool,processed by reinforcing abrasive particles in a conducting metal matrix by powder metallurgy route.The tool electrode is fed into the work material by a servo controlled mechanism.
