Gypsum board comes in 4footwide panels.Length can vary at 8,10,12 or 14feet long.Paper is the most common backing,but aluminum foil backing is available as a vapor barrier where needed.Edges are beveled,rounded,tapered,square or even a tongueandgroove edge.For thicknesses,these are the typical choices and uses:Researching MaintenanceGypsum also isn't a suitable material for pH management because it is essentially neutral in this regard.Lime,of course,will raise pH (in addition to adding calcium),while sulfur and ammonium sulfate are good products for lowering pH.So why would you use gypsum? As already noted,gypsum is an excellent source of calcium.
