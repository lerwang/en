## Bauxite Mining The Australian Aluminium Council
The first step in producing aluminium is mining its ore bauxite.Bauxite occurs mainly in tropical and sub tropical areas,like Africa,the West Indies,South America and Australia there are some small deposits located in Europe.Australia is the largest producer of bauxite,with five mines supplying around 23 per cent of global production.Ore bauxite obtainedBauxite ore requires at least an iron pickaxe to break.Due to this,it is possible to tell bauxite from iron by trying to break it with a stone pickaxe,as bauxite can't be broken with it while iron can.The color is slightly different as well; bauxite ore is a little more dull than iron ore.Get More
