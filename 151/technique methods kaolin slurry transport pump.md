## Centrifugal pump performance calculation for homogeneous,
Centrifugal pumps are widely used for transporting suspensions,but their head performance is derated when non Newtonian fluids and or coarse solids are present Some head deration methods are.Performance prediction of a centrifugal pump delivering,ABSTRACTCentrifugal pump has been used for the transport of the multiphases particularly slurry (solid liquid mixture) in the petroleum and chemical industry The present article describes the experimental analysis of a centrifugal pump delivering non Newtonian fluids and reports the pump’s performance characteristics under different,

## Wastewater treatment
2 &ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Wastewater treatment Wastewater treatment Sludge treatment and disposal: The residue that accumulates in sewage treatment plants is called sludge (or biosolids).Sewage sludge is the solid,semisolid,or slurry residual material that is produced as a by product of wastewater treatment processes.This residue is commonly classified as primary and secondary sludge.Barge Loading and Unloading EquipmentMaterial: Slurry,wet grains,bottom material from environmental cleanup or any material with a wet format.This barge unloading dredger is Not for dry material transport.Common Unload Scenario: The EDDY Pump Excavator Attachment is ideal for pumping slurry from barges,rail cars,pits,lined ponds or other bodies used for material storage.
