## What is Magnetic Separation?
The development of ceramic materials made it possible for permanent magnets to be used for separation.By the end of the 1970s,magnetic separation went through another development with the introduction of three different forms of separation becoming popular: overhead magnets,magnetic pulleys,and the magnetic drum.Separation PlantWe offer a wide range of high performance magnetic separation plant and bespoke separation plant for the recycling industry.At the heart of any material recycling plant are its separators.Our detailed experience of recommending,designing and installing material separators into recycling plant allows us to provide complete separation plant with exceptional levels of material
