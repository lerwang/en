## Fly Ash as a Portland Cement Raw Material
To present the figure in another way,a single plant producing 600,000 tons of cement a year would consume about 1,000,000 tons of raw materials.At a portland cement manufacturing plant,fly ash may be used in the process,principally,at three points.Fly ash and Blast Furnace Slag for Cement ManufacturingFly ash and Blast Furnace Slag for Cement Manufacturing GBFS is slag from the iron production in Basic Oxygen Furnaces.When this slag is actively cooled and ground,GBFS is produced,which can be utilised as a cement or concrete addition.GBFS is said to

## Fly ash
Fly ash material solidifies while suspended in the exhaust gases and is collected by electrostatic precipitators or filter bags.Since the particles solidify rapidly while suspended in the exhaust gases,fly ash particles are generally spherical in shape and range in size from 0.5 &#181;m to 300 &#181;m.The major consequence of the rapid cooling is.Fly Ash Lafarge CanadaFly ash is an extremely fine powder consisting of spherical particles less than 50 microns in size.Fly ash is one of the construction industry's most commonly used pozzolans.Pozzolans are siliceous or siliceous alumina materials.
