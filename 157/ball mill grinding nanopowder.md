## How to Size a Ball Mill
2) Ball milling a ball mill with a diameter of 2.44 meters,inside new liners,grinding wet in open circuit.When the grinding conditions differ from these specified conditions,efficiency factors (Rowland and Kjos,1978) have to be used in conjunction with equation 1.How to Measure Grinding EfficiencyThe first two Grinding Efficiency Measurement examples are given to show how to calculate Wio and Wioc for single stage ball mills.Figure 1.The first example is a comparison of two parallel mills from a daily operating report.Mill size 5.03m x 6.1m (16.5′ x 20′ with a ID of 16′).This example shows that Mill 2 is slightly more efficient than Mill 1 even though it has a higher power.
