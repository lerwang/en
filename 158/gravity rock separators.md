## Gravity Spiral Concentrator Working Principle
The Primary Spirals Separator Feed from the splitter screen passes down into the gravity feed pump hopper and from there it is pumped to the static distributor above six triplex type primary spirals As the pulp passes down these spirals; separaration of particles occurs according to specific gravity and the heavier minerals progress to the inner profile while lighter minerals are forced.Gravity separation WikiMili,The Free EncyclopediaGravity separation is an industrial method of separating two components,either a suspension,or dry granular mixture where separating the components with gravity is sufficiently practical: ie the components of the mixture have different specific weight All of the gravitational methods are common in the sense that they all use gravity as the dominant force
