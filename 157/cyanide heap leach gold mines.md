## Heap leaching a stack of gold MiningFeeds
31&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Heap leaching can take anything from a couple of months to several years.In the case of gold recovery,heap leaching generally requires 60 to 90 days to leach the ore,compared to the 24 hours required by a conventional agitated leach process.Gold recovery is also usually only 70% compared with 90% recovery in an agitated leach plant.Cyanide Use in Gold MiningA sodium cyanide solution is commonly used to leach gold from ore.There are two types of leaching: Heap leaching: In the open,cyanide solution is sprayed over huge heaps of crushed ore spread atop giant collection pads.The cyanide dissolves the gold from the ore into the solution as it trickles through the heap.

## HEAP LEACHING TECHNIQUE in MINING
22&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Heap leaching is a tried and tested mining technique enabling the processing of different kinds of ores which could not otherwise be exploited under viable economic conditions.Modern day heap leaching,which has a relatively low level of energy consumption,is for exampleBarrick Gold halts Veladero mine on fresh cyanide spill.The fresh spill happened on Sep.8,when a pipe carrying process solution in the heap leach area was struck by a large block of ice that had rolled down the heap leach valley slope,Barrick said.

## Heap leaching a stack of gold
Heap leaching has become a popular method of extracting gold,writes Nicolaas C.Steenkamp and Leon Louw.Heap leaching is used to extract gold,copper,silver,uranium,and iodine.This method was first employed to extract copper at the Bluebird mine in the US in the early 1960s,and thenGold Cyanidation Heap LeachingGold Cyanidation Heap Leaching.Heap leaching is a method in which a leaching solution is sprayed with a spray leaching system to selectively leach the useful minerals in the ore and recover the useful mineral from the pregnant liquid flowing out of the heap during the infiltration process.
