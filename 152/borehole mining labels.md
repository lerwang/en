## Predicting Missing Seismic Velocity Values Using Self.
30&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;In general,borehole datasets from mining and exploration environments are typically much localized and incomplete from the point of view of interpreting the causes of geophysical anomalies,in particular anomalous seismic properties,and they limit the success.labels…Two Dimensional Magnetotelluric Modelling of Ore …A combination of magnetotelluric (MT) measurements on the surface and in boreholes (without metal casing) can be expected to enhance resolution and reduce the ambiguity in models of electrical resistivity derived from MT surface measurements alone.In order to quantify potential improvement in inversion models and to aid design of electromagnetic (EM) borehole sensors,we considered two.
