## Field Density Test Of Soil By Sand Cone Method Highway.
Field Density Test ( Sand Cone Method): The sand cone method is one of the most common methods that are used for field density test in highway construction.The dry density test is carried out in the field to check the compaction of the layers.Standard Test Method for Density and Unit Weight of Soil.This standard is a field procedure requiring mass measurements to the nearest 0.01 lbm [5 g].As such,water content calculations should only be reported to nearest 1 % and density to three significant digits.5.2 This test method can be used to determine the in place density of natural soil deposits,aggregates,soil mixtures,or other similar.
