## GCSE CHEMISTRY
A metal above carbon in the reactivity series (potassium,sodium,lithium,calcium,magnesium and aluminium) can be extracted by electrolysis.Extraction of the metal from its ore involves reduction of the metal ions.Electrons are able to reduce any metal ion.metalThe Extraction of CopperThe Process The concentrated ore is heated strongly with silicon dioxide (silica) and air or oxygen in a furnace or series of furnaces.The copper(II) ions in the chalcopyrite are reduced to copper(I) sulfide (which is reduced further to copper metal in the final stage).
