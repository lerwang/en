## Influence of copper minerals on cyanide leaching of gold.
31 May 2000.Experimental results show that not all the total copper in an ore affected cyanide leaching of gold,while cyaniding easily soluble copper turns out to be the decisive factor that interferes with gold cyanidation by causing decrease in gold cyanidation recovery and increase in cyanide consumption.Leaching of gold and silver from printed circuit board of mobile phonesThe first characterization of gold and silver was performed with aqua regia.The results show 86.26g Au ton of PCBs and 123.85g Ag ton of PCBs.The second characterization was performed with a commercial cyanide based reagent and 112.02g Au ton of PCBs and 26.13g Ag ton of PCBs were obtained.A leaching study&nbsp;.
