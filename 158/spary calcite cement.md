Blocky calcite cement also occurs,filling former moldic pores in some dolostone samples (Fig.3b2,b6).Concave meniscus,isopachous equant spary calcite and syntaxial overgrowth cements are very common in sandstones (Fig.3b4,b6,b8).Cementation (geology)Calcite is indispensable in the construction industry,forming the base of cement.Many important chemicals are created from Calcite,as well as useful drugs.It is also crucial in the manufacture of fertilizers,metals,glass,rubber,and paint.
