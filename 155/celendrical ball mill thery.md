## Grinding in Ball Mills: Modeling and Process Control
Keywords: Ball mills,grinding circuit,process control.I.Introduction Grinding in ball mills is an important technological process applied to reduce the size of particles which may have different nature and a wide diversity of physical,mechanical and chemical characteristics.Typical examples are the various ores,minerals,limestone,etc.SIZE REDUCTION AND SIZE SEPARATIONIn this mill the larger balls remain within the cylinder and the smaller balls are collected in the conical portion.As a result,coarser grinding takes place in the cylinder portion and finer grinding takes place in the apex of the conical portion.The product is more finer and uniform than general cylindrical ball mill.
