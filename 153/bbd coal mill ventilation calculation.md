## Numerical Study on Spontaneous Combustion of Coal in …
The ventilation conditions used in the simulation were based on a local Pittsburgh coal seam mine’s ventilation data.The pressure was 3.0 inches water gauge at the intake inlet, 3.5 inches water gauge at the return outCO and CO2 emissions from spontaneous heating of coal.emissions from spontaneous heating of a U.S.coal sample were evaluated in an isothermal oven under different airﬂow ventilation rates ranging from 100 to 500 cm.3 min.Laboratory experiments were conducted at oven temperatures of 70,90,and 100 &#176;C.The temperature at the
