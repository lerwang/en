## Uses of Bentonite in Construction
Bentonite is a type of clay that has an ability to swell and gel when dispersed in water which is used in construction mainly in excavation and foundation works.The word Bentonite is a toponym taken from a place called Fort Benton in USA,where it was discovered as a clay ore.WO2015057489A1The current technology relates to mining processes and compositions which inhibit the growth of complex scale.More specifically it relates to a process for preventing inhibiting and or controlling gypsum scale in aqueous mineral ore slurries,and for inhibiting scale.
