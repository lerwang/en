Since decomposition is the crux of the composting process,let’s take a look at the various organisms that play an essential role in the working compost heap.Most are microscopic,some are large enough to be observed with the unaided eye,but all are beneficial,each having a role in breaking down raw organic matter into finished compost.Germination of Seeds: Research on SalinityThe aim of this experiment is to find out how the salinity of water affects the optimum germination of seeds.A seed is a small embryonic plant enclosed in a covering called the seed coat,usually with some stored food (“Seed”,2016).There are mainly two types of seeds: monocots and dicots.
