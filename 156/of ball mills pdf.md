## Ball Mill
Ball mills are among the most variable and effective tools when it comes to size reduction of hard,brittle or fibrous materials.The variety of grinding modes,usable volumes and available grinding tool materials make ball mills the perfect match for a vast range of applications.Industrial Ball Mills: Steel Ball Mills and Lined Ball.Ball Mills Steel Ball Mills &amp; Lined Ball Mills.Particle size reduction of materials in a ball mill with the presence of metallic balls or other media dates back to the late 1800’s.The basic construction of a ball mill is a cylindrical container with journals at its axis.
