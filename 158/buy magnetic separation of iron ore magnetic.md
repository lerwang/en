## Magnetic Separation
Iron ore processors may also employ magnetic separation for beneficiation of classifier output streams.Wet high intensity magnetic separators (WHIMS) may be used to extract high grade fine particles from gangue,due to the greater attraction of the former to the applied magnetic field.
