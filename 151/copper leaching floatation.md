copper flotationcopper flotation and leaching Flotation or Heap Leaching? Heap leaching is an industrial mining process to extract precious metals,copper,uranium,and other compounds from ore via a series of chemical reactions that absorb specific minerals and then re Processing of chalcopyrite ore by heap leaching and flotationIntroduction to Mineral Processing Chevron Phillips ChemicalOxide copper ore,low grade copper sulfide overburden,and other copper containing materials are stacked into a heap Leach solution (pH approximately 2) is sprinkled or flooded on top of the heap and percolates through The leach solution containing the dissolved metal eventually flows out of the heap into a collection pond
