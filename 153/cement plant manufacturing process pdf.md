## The Cement Manufacturing Process
There are more than twenty types of cement used to make various specialty concrete,however the most common is Portland cement.Cement manufacturing is a complex process that begins with mining and then grinding raw materials that include limestoneWhat is the difference between the dry and wet …In dry process all the materials in powder form are ground separated in the absence of water and then mixed in the desired proportion and the resultant product is fed into kiln for burning.This process results less consumption of energy.And low.
