## Hydrocyclones
At the conical end is the second outlet,the spigot.For size separation,both outlets are generally open to the atmosphere.Hydrocyclones are generally operated vertically with the spigot at the lower end,hence the coarse product is called the underflow and the fine product,leaving the vortex finder,the overflow.beas efficient in gold hydrocyclonesA hydrocyclone (often referred to by the shortened form cyclone) is a dev to classify,separate or sort particles in a liquid suspension based on the ratio of their centripetal force to fluid resistance.This ratio is high for dense (where separation by density is required) and coarse (where separation by size is required) particles,and low for.
