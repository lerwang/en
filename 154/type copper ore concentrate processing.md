## How is Copper Ore Processed
The Chingola open pit mining operation showing the bucket wheel excavator operating at night.PRIMARY CRUSHING—The ore is hoisted from the two shafts in nominal ton capacity skips and discharged into ton capacity surge bins at the head frame,from which it is withdrawn by Amsco feeders fitted with variable speed drives and chain feeders to even out the flow.Copper Mining and Processing: Processing of Copper Ores …Copper processing is a complicated process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper called cathodes,which will ultimately be made into products for everyday use.The most common types of ore,copper oxide and copper sulfide,undergo two different processes,hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy,respectively,due to the different.
