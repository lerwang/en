## Extraction of Gold
The extraction of gold by the cyanide method is of great technical importance.It is effected by lixiviation with a solution of potassium cyanide,the gold being precipitated either by addition of zinc or electrolytically.The process was suggested by Mac Arthur and Forrest in 1385,and is based on the well known solubility of gold in potassium.Gold ExtractionThe increase in gold extraction can be attributed to increases in residual Cu(II) in solution with increasing pH value resulting from the increase in free NH 3 (Senanayake,2004a,b).Leaching at a higher pH value can also be beneficial in improving silver extraction and stabilizing silver in solution.
