## Crusher
A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks,gravel,or rock dust.Crushers may be used to reduce the size,or change the form,of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled,or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore),so that pieces of different composition cTips to maximize crushing efficiency&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Additionally,jaw crusher feed should be pre screened using a grizzly screen prior to crushing to remove material finer than the closed side setting.Setting jaw crushers.Ideally,the reduction ratio of a jaw crusher should be 6 to 1.There are different ways to calculate reduction ratio,but the best way is something called the P80 factor.
