## Aggregate Properties
2019 11 1&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;However,aggregate in concrete is stronger than the concrete for conventional concrete,while the aggregate strength is lower than concrete strength for high strength concrete,where the cementitious matrix is extremely strong.Aggregate strength depends on its parent rock composition,texture and structure.Gradation and Size2020 2 22&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The particle size distribution,or gradation,of an aggregate is one of the most influential aggregate characteristics in determining how it will perform as a pavement material.In HMA,gradation helps determine almost every important property including stiffness,stability,durability,permeability,workability,fatigue resistance,frictional resistance and moisture susceptibility (Roberts et.

These materials include gravel,sand,or crushed stone mixed with water which is all added to the cement mixture to create concrete.The most common size of aggregate used in the concrete mix is 20 mm for coarse aggregate and particle size less than 4.75 mm for fine aggregate.Size of test cylinderThe nominal maximum size of an aggregate is the smallest sieve opening through which the entire amount of aggregate is permitted to pass.Hence,a 4 x 8 in.(100 x 200 mm) can be specified if no aggregate used for making the concrete cylinder is retained on a 1&#188; in.(31.5 mm) sieve.
