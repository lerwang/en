## Primary Crusher Selection &amp; Design
How you select your primary crusher will be based on factors like moisture content,maximum rock lump size,material density SG,abrasion index,degradability and it being prone to dusting or not.The crusher capacities given by manufacturers are typically in tons of 2,000 lbs.and are based on crushing limestone weighing loose about 2,700 lbs.per yard3 and having a specific gravity of 2.6.Mechanical screeningMechanical screening,often just called screening,is the practice of taking granulated ore material and separating it into multiple grades by particle size.This practice occurs in a variety of industries such as mining and mineral processing,agriculture,pharmaceutical,food,plastics,and recycling.
