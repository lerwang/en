## Coal National Geographic Society
Coal exists in underground formations called “coal seams” or “coal beds.” A coal seam can be as thick as 30 meters (90 feet) and stretch 1,500 kilometers (920 miles).Coal seams exist on every continent.The largest coal reserves are in the United StatesCoalbed methaneCoalbed methane (CBM or coal bed methane),coalbed gas,coal seam gas (CSG),or coal mine methane (CMM) is a form of natural gas extracted from coal beds.In recent decades it has become an important source of energy in United States,Canada,Australia
