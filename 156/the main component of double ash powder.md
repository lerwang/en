## Fly ash
Fly ash material solidifies while suspended in the exhaust gases and is collected by electrostatic precipitators or filter bags.Since the particles solidify rapidly while suspended in the exhaust gases,fly ash particles are generally spherical in shape and range in size from 0.5 &#181;m to 300 &#181;m.The major consequence of the rapid cooling is.Baking powderBaking powder is a dry chemical leavening agent,a mixture of a carbonate or bicarbonate and a weak acid.The base and acid are prevented from reacting prematurely by the inclusion of a buffer such as cornstarch.Baking powder is used to increase the volume and lighten the texture of baked goods.It works by releasing carbon dioxide gas into a.

## How baking powder is made
Toothpaste is a paste or gel dentifrice used with a toothbrush to clean and maintain the aesthetics and health of teeth.Toothpaste is used to promote oral hygiene: it is an abrasive that aids in removing dental plaque and food from the teeth,assists in suppressing halitosis,and delivers active ingredients (most commonly fluoride) to help prevent tooth decay (dental caries) and gum disease ().Smokeless powderSmokeless powder is the name given to a number of propellants used in firearms and artillery that produce negligible smoke when fired,unlike the gunpowder or black powder they replaced.The term is unique to the United States and is generally not used in other English speaking countries,[1] which initially used proprietary names such as.
