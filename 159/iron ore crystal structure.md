Pyrope: Pyrope is the iron magnesium and aluminum silicate of the pyrope almandine series in the Pyralspite group of the Garnet family.Its beautiful deep red gem quality makes it one of the most popular.Pure pyrope is colorless,but its red color,sometimes very bright,is due to small quantities of chrome in the crystal structure.Different Types of Iron Ore2&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Hematite is the most important iron ore.The iron content of the pure minerals is as follows: Ankerite is a carbonate of lime,magnesia,manganese,and iron.It is of valuable composition,carries only 14 or 15% of iron,and is used more for its lime and magnesia as a flux than for its iron content.

Ore is a deposit in Earth’s crust of one or more valuable minerals.The most valuable ore deposits contain metals crucial to industry and trade,like copper,gold,and iron.Copper ore is mined for a variety of industrial uses.Copper,an excellent conductor of electricity,is used as electrical wire.Copper is also used in construction.Iron Ore: Sedimentary Rock2&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The primary use of iron ore is in the production of iron.Most of the iron produced is then used to make steel.Steel is used to make automobiles,locomotives,ships,beams used in buildings,furniture,paper clips,tools,reinforcing rods for concrete,bicycles,and thousands of other items.It is the most used metal by both tonnage and purpose.

## Allotropes of iron
8&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The exact temperatures at which iron will transition from one crystal structure to another depends on how much and what type of other elements are dissolved in the iron.The phase boundary between the different solid phases is drawn on a binary phase diagram,usually plotted as temperature versus percent iron.PYRITE (Iron Sulfide)Pyrite is a polymorph of marcasite,which means that it has the same chemistry,FeS2,as marcasite; but a different structure and therefore different symmetry and crystal shapes.Pyrite is difficult to distinguish from marcasite when a lack of clear indicators exists.Pyrite's structure is analogous to galena's structure with a formula of PbS.

## Iron: Mineral information,data and localities.
Very rare in igneous and sedimentary rocks.Forms the majority of the earth's core.Nickel is commonly reported in iron in quantities up to several percents; meteoric iron generally contains at least 5%,and up to 25% to 65%,nickel.MAGNETITE (Iron Oxide)Magnetite is the primary oxide of iron found in meteorites (and thus presumably in asteroids).Thermite is a mixture of powdered magnetite and powdered aluminum.When ignited,the aluminum fuel burns using the magnetite as an oxidizer,resulting in much heat,aluminum oxide (corundum),and molten iron.
