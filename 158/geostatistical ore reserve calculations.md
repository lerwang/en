## Geostatistics
Geostatistics is a branch of statistics focusing on spatial or spatiotemporal datasets.Developed originally to predict probability distributions of ore grades for mining operations,[1] it is currently applied in diverse disciplines including petroleum geology,hydrogeology,hydrology,meteorology,oceanography,geochemistry,geometallurgy.Handbook of applied advanced geostatistical ore reserve …This book describes the advances made in the last 15 years,which have practical applications in ore reserve estimation.In particular,it addresses the problems commonly encountered in the practice of orebody modelling when the data do not conform to the early theoretical models.
