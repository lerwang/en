## Cement
A cement is a binder,a substance used for construction that sets,hardens,and adheres to other materials to bind them together.Cement is seldom used on its own,but rather to bind sand and gravel together.Cement mixed with fine aggregate produces mortar for masonry,or with sand and gravel,produces concrete.ManufacturingManufacturing the cement kiln Most Portland cement is made in a rotary kiln.Basically,this is a long cylinder rotating about its axis once every minute or two.The axis is inclined at a slight angle,the end with the burner being lower.The rotation causes the raw.
