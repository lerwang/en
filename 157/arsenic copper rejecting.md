The floatability of enargite (3Cu 2 S.As 2 S 5 ) has been determined as a function of pulp potential to establish whether the flotation behaviour of the mineral differs sufficiently from that of other copper minerals thus offering the prospect of rejecting arsenic from the Tampakan ore by potential control during flotation.The results of a single mineral flotation study reveal that a.METALLURGICAL CONTROL AND SOCIAL POWER.THE BRONZE …widely debated,rejecting or accepting it based on the differential presence of arsenic in the instruments produced,although this should imply more than the addition of arsenic in itself,the choice of copper minerals rich in arsenic,or perhaps,their being alloyed

Introduction The current IsaKidd technology represents the merger of the copper refining technologies developed by the two different organisations.The initial Isa Process development in the late 1970s,with its reusable stainless steel cathode starter sheets,represented an advance on the previous technology of single use starter sheets of pure copper,the production of which was a labour.Nickel Cobalt Copper Conferenceprocess is unique in offering high selectivity to copper whilst rejecting iron,having loading capacities that compare favourably with less selective resins and in addition the resin can be eluted with sulfuric acid yielding a copper stream suitable for return to solvent
