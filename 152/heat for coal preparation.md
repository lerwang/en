## Gross Calorific Value
Coal is used primarily as a fuel,so its most important property is its heat of combustion.Gross calorific value,also known as higher heating value (HHV),is determined by measuring the heat released when coal is burned in a constant volume calorimeter,with an intitial oxygen pressure of 2 to 4 MPA,and when the combustion products are.coal utilization Volatile Matter &amp; Chemistry Britannica2 &ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Coal utilization,combustion of coal or its conversion into useful solid,gaseous,and liquid products.By far the most important use of coal is in combustion,mainly to provide heat to the boilers of electric power plants.Metallurgical coke is the major product of coal conversion.In addition,techniques for gasifying and liquefying coal into fuels or into feedstocks for the chemical.
