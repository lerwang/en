## A Robust Stochastic Fractal Search approach for.
Grinding as an abrasive machining process,uses a high speed rotational grinding wheel to remove chips from the surface of workpiece.In the last years,computer numerical control grinding machines has been developed according to the material property,geometry of workpiece and process specifications.Types of Grinding MachineThe grinding is a simple process in which very small size of chips are remove from work piece by rubbing action of an abrasive material.But at different condition according to the working environment,different types of grinding machines is used.Types of Grinding Machine:
