## Concrete mix design
2 &ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Concrete is a mixture of several natural constiuents.These include: * A binder: cement,which hardens in the presence of water; * Water: it is required for the cement to harden and in order to lay it.However,care is necessary as too much water reduces the strength and durability of the concrete.Steel reinforcing in concrete9&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Sometimes steel reinforcing in concrete is put there to strengthen it,help hold the concrete together and limit cracking.In many cases,bigger concrete jobs that require reinforcing steel usually also require a building permit of some kind,in which case the reinforcing steel requirements will be documented on the plans.
