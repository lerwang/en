## High Temperature Corrosion Resistant Coatings The DECC.
For corrosion resistant coatings,we utilizes both barrier and sacrificial types of engineered coatings.we are capable of working with any corrosion resistant coating.We excel at solving problems and welcome the opportunity to work with complex components that have never been coated for corrosion protection.Stainless steelIn metallurgy,stainless steel,also known as inox steel or inox from French inoxydable (inoxidizable),is a steel alloy,with a minimum of 11% chromium content by mass and a maximum of 1.2% carbon by mass.Stainless steels are most notable for their corrosion resistance,which increases with increasing chromium content.Additions of molybdenum increases corrosion res

## Stainless steel
In 1912,Harry Brearley of the Brown Firth research laboratory in Sheffield,England,while seeking a corrosion resistant alloy for gun barrels,discovered and subsequently industrialized a martensitic stainless steel alloy.The discovery was announced two years later.Zinc Coatings American Galvanizers AssociationZinc,a natural,healthy,and abundant element was first used in construction in 79 AD.Zinc metal has a number of characteristics that make it a well suited corrosion protective coating for iron and steel products.Zincsexcellent corrosion resistance in most environments accounts for its successful use as a protective coating on a variety of products and in many exposure conditions.

When plates,sheets and other materials made of steel are produced,they produce a mill scale consisting of iron oxides that layer on the top surface,protecting the underlying steel from corrosion.Coatings cannot be applied over this mill coating,so the mill coating must be removed before further protective processes are performed.CorrosionBecause corrosion is a diffusion controlled process,it occurs on exposed surfaces.As a result,methods to reduce the activity of the exposed surface,such as passivation and chromate conversion,can increase a material's corrosion resistance.However,some corro
