The maximum particle size is important because it controls the appropriate lift thickness of the mixture placement For good paving results,the lift thickness of a dense graded asphalt mix should be 2&#189; to 3 times the maximum aggregate size or 3 to 4 times the nominal aggregate size in the mixAggregate size Concrete Construction Magazine ,Aggregate size Materials Posted on: June 01,1961 Features Aggregate size,At a given water ratio,within the range employed in most structural concrete,smaller maximum sizes of aggregate will tend to produce higher concrete strengths than larger on 2 The larger sizes will require less mixing water and hence,for a given cement.
