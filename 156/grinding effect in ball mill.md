The High Energy Ball Mill E max and MM 500 were developed for grinding with the highest energy input.The innovative design of both,the mills and the grinding jars,allows for continuous grinding down to the nano range in the shortest amount of time with only minor warming effects.These ball mills are also suitable for mechano chemistry.Slurry density effects on ball milling in a laboratory ball …The effect of slurry density on the dynamics and grinding behavior of a batch ball mill was studied using quartz as a test material.It was found that slurry density determined the distribution of solid charge in the mill,with migration of particles from the tumbling zone.

## Grinding mill machine
In terms of working mode,it can be divided into centrifugal grinding mill,pin mill grinder,jet air grinder,roller mill grinder.All the mills that work in impact manner such as hummer mill,discs mill,pin mill,ball mills,etc.are collectively referred to as “impact mill”.The mill that work by high pressure airflow are called jet mill.How to improve the grinding efficiency of the ball mill.The grinding concentration is high,the adhesion of the material around the steel ball is good,the impact and grinding effect of the steel ball on the material are good,but the slurry flow is slow,which is easy to cause the material to be pulverized,which is not conducive to improving the processing capacity of the mill.
