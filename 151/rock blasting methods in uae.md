## Typical Blasting Methods for Structural Engineering Operations
The blasting method is used for rock excavation Controlled blasting is a technique of blasting,which is used to reduce the amount of over break and to control ground vibrations The different types of controlled blasting techniques are pre splitting,smooth blasting,line drilling,perimeter blasting,and cushion blastingNxburst™ Safety Cartridges For Rock Breaking GeoBreakNxburst™ is a non detonating blasting technology used to break rock and concrete Designed as a safe alternative to traditional explosives,Nxburst™ Rock Breaking Safety Cartridges are used in a wide range of construction,demolition,mining,and quarrying environments The cartridges do not produce a destructive shock wave like detonating.

## How Much Does Rock Excavation Cost? …
4&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;How much does rock excavation cost? Depending on the type of rock,the size of the job,placement,contractor rates,the equipment being used,and geographical location,most rock excavation jobs will cost $5 to $35 per cubic yard if a blasting method is used,but this price could be much higher if it were a public bid job.Because all jobs will be so unique,highly consider a free quote.Chapter 11 SPECIALIZED BLASTING TECHNIQUESblasting of cornices increases efficiency,boring holes along the presumed tension line exposes the ava lanche blaster to considerable danger Safety in borehole blasting depends critically on: 1 The blasting crews ability to judge correctly the safe working line techniques for working with this high explosive (See Chapter 5 Detonating Cord)
