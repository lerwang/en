## Mineral resources information Australia Minerals
Australia’s unique geology has paved the way for over 300 operating mining projects and many more exploration projects.Currently,Australia has the world’s largest resources of gold,iron ore,lead,rutile,tantalum,uranium,zinc and zircon and the second largest resources of bauxite,brown coal,cobalt,copper,ilmenite,lithium,nickel,and tungsten.Mineral Resources2020 3 1&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Besides export,the iron ore were consumed by the local cement,and iron and steel plants.Malaysia’s steel industry also imports iron ore for their manufacturing requirements in the form of lumps and pellets,mainly from Brazil,Chile and Bahrain.Manganese: Manganese ore is an important raw material in iron and steel production.
