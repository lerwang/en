## Titaniferous Magnetite Deposits of the Laramie Range,Wyoming
Titaniferous Magnetite Deposits of the Laramie Range,Wyoming* By R A DIEMf:R INTRODUCTION Titaniferous iron ore deposits in the Laramie Range were first reported in 1850 by Stansbury (22: 266)t They have since been found at a number of localities in the form of dike like bodies in an area ofCharacterizing Megascopic Textrues in Fluorospar Ores at,Magnetite Rims Where the pods of fluorite ore were formed by the replacement of pegmatitic carbonatite,remnants of the partly replaced to unreplaced carbonatite may locally remain to attest to the character of the replaced rock (Figure 3a and Figure 3b)More commonly,however,all traces of the calcite in the original pegmatitic carbonatite are replaced by fluorite,and only,
