## limestone Characteristics,Uses,&amp; Facts Britannica
Limestone has two origins: (1) biogenic precipitation from seawater,the primary agents being lime secreting organisms and foraminifera; and (2) mechanical transport and deposition of preexisting limestones,forming clastic deposits.Travertine,tufa,caliche,chalk,sparite,and micrite are all varieties of limestone.Assessment of groundwater inflows into Kuteshwar.8&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL) is carrying out limestone open cast mining in Kuteshwar limestone mines about 60 km NNE of Katni town,Katni district,Madhya Pradesh for the steel plant.The limestone deposits of Kajrahat series of Vindhyan Super Group,occurring in Chhoti Mahanadi river basin near Kuteshwar,form a single largest reserve of about 800 million tons of SMS grade.
