## Heap leaching
Heap leaching is an industrial mining process used to extract precious metals,copper,uranium,and other compounds from ore using a series of chemical reactions that absorb specific minerals and re separate them after their division from other earth materials.Going for gold: A non toxic solution to gold leachingUsed during gold leaching primarily for the extraction of fine gold,it is used in over 90 per cent of global gold production,but in modern times its harmful,toxic nature has seen regional bans.
