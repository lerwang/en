## Size reduction
Ball mills (wet) Ball mills,as described above,are also a machine of choice for milling solids in wet phase.The design applied here is mainly a ball mill with an agitator,the movement of the agitator making the beads move and impact or friction the particles to be milled.The operating principle of the ball millThe operating principle of the ball mill consists of following steps.In a continuously operating ball mill,feed material fed through the central hole one of the caps into the drum and moves therealong,being exposed by grinding media.The material grinding occurs during impact falling grinding balls and abrasion the particles between the balls.

## Grinding in Ball Mills: Modeling and Process Control
52 the milling process takes place during rotation as a result of the transfer of kinetic energy of the moving grinding media into the grinding product.The design of a ball mill can vary significantly depending on the size,the equipment used to load the starting materialMineral processingThe primarily used equipment in crushing are jaw crushers,gyratory crushers and cone crushers whereas rod mills and ball mills,closed circuited with a classifier unit,are generally employed for grinding purposes in a mineral processing plant.Crushing is a dry process whereas grinding is generally performed
