## On Aggregate Grading
On Aggregate Grading is good concrete performance dependent on meeting grading limits? Specifying concrete mixtures with well graded (WG) combined aggregates can be controversial.Advocates1 4 argue that such mixtures have optimized packing and minimal voids and therefore minimize the cementitious pasteEffect on Compressive Strength of Concrete by Partial.Abstract The cement is the main ingredient used for concrete.The production of cement involves emission of large amount of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.Therefore,the search of any other such material which can be used as an alternative to cement should lead …

## Conversion of Mill Scale Waste into Valuable Products via.
Mill scale is one of waste materials which is produced as a result of hot rolling of steel in all steel companies.On the other hand,mill scale is considered a rich iron source with minimum impurities.This work aims at conversion of mill scale by adjusting smelting processes to produce different valuable products.The smelting processes were carried out using carbothermic reduction in a.Portland Cement Type I II SakretePortland Cement I II is one of key components in making concrete and portland lime mortars.When mixed with sand and coarse aggregate it produces concrete.When mixed with lime and mason sand it produces mortar.Use For: Custom concrete mixes for both concrete slabs or for repairs where the concrete will be at least 2” (51 mm) thick.
