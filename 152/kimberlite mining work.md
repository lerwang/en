## The application of 3D modeling technology to the kimberlite.
Through carrying out 3D modeling work,some new understanding about the shape of the kimberlite pipe in the area and the direction of deep prospecting was obtained.It is held that the 3D model can better display the spatial distribution of kimberlitetypeGeophysical Survey Methods in Diamond Exploration.Geophysical methods are particularly useful in diamond exploration.They tend to work well because kimberlite pipes,the diamond hosting rock,generally have properties that are different from the surrounding rock.In addition,the data provide most of the guidance on where to position drillholes.

Diamonds in Canada? Throughout the 20th century most people would never have thought about Canada being an important producer of diamonds.[1] Most people's knowledge of diamonds was fixed on mining operations in Africa and diamond trading centers in Europe.All of this started to change in 1991 when two geologists,Chuck Fipke and Stewart Blusson,found evidence of diamond bearing kimberlite.Method and mechanized system for mining kimberlite …Method for testing kimberlite pipes,where the ventilation and transport horizons contour kimberlite pipes are counting drifts,which hit between a vertical ventilation way Bonami.The task of mining under the zones of increased flooding.In the center of the tube Buryats …

## Carbon and Kimberlite HowStuffWorks
Diamonds form about 100 miles (161 km) below the Earth's surface,in the molten rock of the Earth's mantle,which provides the right amounts of pressure and heat to transform carbon into diamond.In order for a diamond to be created,carbon must be placed under at least 435,113 pounds per square inch (psi or 30 kilobars) of pressure at a temperature of at least 752 degrees Fahrenheit (400 Celsius).BlueRock Diamonds signs deal to mine kimberlite pipe.BlueRock Diamonds on Tuesday said it has entered an agreement with Koedonza Olives to mine a 1.5 hectare kimberlite pipe,known as Jubilee,which lies north of Kimberly,South Africa.BlueRock will cover all the costs of a planned bulk sampling effort and any future mining.In return,any future.

8&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;How We Find Diamond Sources: Kimberlite and Lamproite.How We Find Diamond Sources: Kimberlite and Lamproite.We have already described how diamonds are brought to the surface of the Earth in kimberlite and lamproite pipes,and that these volcanic events occur within continental cratons,where the conditions exist to help diamonds maintain.In Search of Diamonds: An Introduction to Kimberlite.Kimberlite is a volcanic rock that occurs in diatremes,or narrow volcanic “pipes”.It may also occur in vertically oriented narrow sheets,or dikes.Once a kimberlite is found there is no guarantee that economic grades of diamonds,or any diamonds at all will be found,but it’s a good start.
