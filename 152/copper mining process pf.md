## What are the main methods of mining? American.
9&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;There are four main mining methods: underground,open surface (pit),placer,and in situ mining.Underground mines are more expensive and are often used to reach deeper deposits.Surface mines are typically used for more shallow and less valuable deposits.Placer mining is used to sift out valuable metals from sediments in river channels,beach sands,or other environments.copper10&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Copper(II) ions oxidise iodide ions to iodine,and in the process are themselves reduced to copper(I) iodide.Note: If you need to,you can find out more about oxidation states by following this link.Use the BACK button on your browser to return to this page.

## Copper Mining and Processing: Processing of Copper …
Copper processing is a complicated process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper called cathodes,which will ultimately be made into products for everyday use.The most common types of ore,copper oxide and copper sulfide,undergo two different processes,hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy,respectively,due to the different.Gold Smelting &amp; Refining Process4&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;For many years,the term bullion made reference to coins and the name base bullion is for pig lead or copper bottoms obtained in smelting operations of lead and copper concentrates.The last product is characterized for containing small amounts of gold and silver.The treatment of these products depends on the metallurgical extractive process.

## The Effects of Oxidation on Copper Sciencing
Copper is a versatile metal used in thousands of everyday products.It oxidizes readily to form a distinctive coating known as patina.The patina gives the Statue of Liberty its characteristic appearance,but the oxidation of copper can also cause undesirable effects under some circumstances.Copper Ore Processing Methods9&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The four major steps in the production of marketable copper are mining,concentrating,smelting,and refining.In a few instances,however,leaching takes the place of concentrating,smelting,and refining.At present,although considerable leaching and direct smelting ores are produced,the bulk of the copper ore mined is concentrated.The milling of copper ores as practiced in the larger.
