## Ball Mills
Ball Mills are generally used to grind material 1 4 inch and finer,down to the particle size of 20 to 75 microns.To achieve a reasonable efficiency with ball mills,they must be operated in a closed system,with oversize material continuously being recirculated back into the mill to be reduced.End Mill QuestionsEND MILLS Q: Can I use end mills in a drill press? A: It is not recommended as it can pose a possible danger of shattering and it is hard on the drill presses spindle bearings.Q: What style of end mill can be used to &quot;plunge&quot; cut? A: Two flute end mills are &quot;center cutting&quot; and often called &quot;slot drills&quot; because they can plunge cut and drill into the material prior to traversing.
