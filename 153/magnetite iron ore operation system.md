## Magnetite IRON ORE
Magnetite Mines Limited is an iron ore focussed mineral exploration company exploring for magnetite iron ore in the Mawson Iron Province of South Australia.Transfer Chute Plugging Solved at Iron Ore Export. JenikeThe iron ore is highly abrasive and would wear parts of the transfer chute that did not experience severe plugging.A rock box design was implemented to reduce wear,but because the iron ore was cohesive at times,the chute would plug.
