## Difference Between Annealing and Tempering Metal.
The difference between annealing and tempering comes down to how it is treated.Annealing involves heating steel to a specified temperature and then cooling at a very slow and controlled rate,whereas tempering involves heating the metal to a precise temperature below the critical point,and is often done in air,vacuum or inert atmospheres.Page 1 Page 2 INTRODUCTION SAG2014 10 1&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;grinding media availability and throughput.These requirements favour fine crushing and the use of steel media.Processing of a competent ore at a coarse target grind size may require the inclusion of a recycle crusher to a single stage AG or SAG circuit to prevent over grinding.This inclusion may not always be required if the target grind is.
