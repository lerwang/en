## What are the main methods of mining?
2 &ensp;&#0183;&ensp;There are four main mining methods: underground,open surface (pit),placer,and in situ mining.Underground mines are more expensive and are often used to reach deeper deposits.Surface mines are typically used for more shallow and less valuable deposits.Placer mining is used to sift out valuable metals from sediments in river channels,beach sands,or other environments.MiningMining Mining Surface mining: It has been estimated that more than two thirds of the world’s yearly mineral production is extracted by surface mining.There are several types of surface mining,but the three most common are open pit mining,strip mining,and quarrying.These differ from one another in the mine geometries created,the techniques used,and the minerals produced.Open pit.

11&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Unregulated mining has the potential to release harmful substances into the soil,air,and water.Mission 2016 proposes that governments enforce regulations on companies and use cutting edge technology to reduce the damage from mining related sources.As more mines open in countries with varying levels of environmental protection,it is.What is open cut mining?27&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;computers to electric cars these items are made by mining and processing minerals into metals and other materials.Open cut mining is one method used to extract these minerals from the earth.Open cut mining is used when the minerals are found over a large area and relatively close to the surface.The open cut mine is dug downwards in benches.

## Uranium: How is it Mined?
Open Pit Mining.Open pit mining,also known as strip mining,is the removal of surficial soils and uneconomic rock to get at the ore below.Ore grades are normally less than 0.5%.This is type of mining is only possible if the uranium ore is near the surface (normally less than 400 ft).Open Pit Mining Methods8&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Open pit mining methods are applicable to mining ore deposits that apex at or near the surface.If the deposit apexes below the surface,the overburden and barren capping overlying the ore must be removed in advance of open pit mining.The removal of this material is known as stripping.

## Underground Mining Methods — New Pacific Metals
Cut and fill mining can be expensive,but this method allows for highly selective mining with less waste rock or low grade ores mined out (which keeps production costs low).It’s typically used in situations where the orebody dips steeply or is very irregular,which makes mechanized long hole methods difficult to implement.ShrinkageMining Methods • Environment GuideMinerals in the terrestrial environment may be mined using underground or open cast methods.Open cast mining is used in situation where the minerals are relatively shallow or less concentrated.Underground mining is used for deposits at greater depth,higher grade deposits,or vein ores.
