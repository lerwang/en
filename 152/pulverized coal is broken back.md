## Performance of Coal Burning Steam Locomotives
5&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The combustion of coal used to fire a steam locomotive is dependent upon oxygen,and the igniting temperature of the fuel.Before actual burning occurs,however,the coal,with aid of existing heat in the firebox,must be broken down into its component parts,namely coke and gases.The coke consists of fixed carbon and substancesPulverized Iron2&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Pulverized Iron is created by pulverizing Iron Ore.It can be smelted to produce an Iron Ingot or mixed with Ferrous Metal (or Nickel) to create Invar Blend.There is also a 10% chance to produce Pulverized Iron when pulverizing Tin Ore into Pulverized Tin or Aluminum Ore into Pulverized …
