## Density Of Concrete How Much Does Concrete Weigh?
A normal weight concrete weighs 2400 kg per cubic meter or 145 lbs per cubic foot (3915 lbs per cubic yard).The unit weight of concrete (density) varies depending on the amount and density of the aggregate,the amount of entrained air (and entrapped air),and the water and cement content.How many liters water is needed for every cubic …7&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Concrete will set up.Back fill hole,install rest of mailbox.Options Put water in hole first then add concrete,make it &quot;soupy&quot;,Push post in.OR Not add water,concrete will set up anyways,unless you live in the desert.It will absorb the water from the ground.Mix concrete in hole,save the bucket,wheelbarrow,mixer,etc.

Water Cement Ratio is defined as the ratio between the weight of the water to the weight of cement.In general terms,w c ratio means how much water it requires for the particular mix.We all know that the water cement ratio will directly affect the strength of concrete.Concrete mix designConcrete is a mixture of several natural constiuents.These include: * A binder: cement,which hardens in the presence of water; * Water: it is required for the cement to harden and in order to lay it.However,care is necessary as too much water reduces the strength and durability of the concrete.
