## The optimal cone crusher for crushing plant
The cone crusher is widely used in many sectors such as mining,smelting,building materials,roads,railways,water conservancy,and chemical industries.The cone stone crusher has a large crushing ratio,high efficiency,low energy consumption and uniform product size.It is suitable for medium and fine crushed ores and rocks.Cone Crushers McLanahanCone Crusher Applications.A general rule of thumb for applying Cone Crushers is the reduction ratio.A crusher with coarse style liners would typically have a 6:1 reduction ratio.Thus,with a 3⁄4” closed side setting,the maximum feed would be 6 x 3⁄4 or 4.5 inches.Reduction ratios of 8:1 may be p
