## Sodium carbonate
Sodium carbonate is soluble in water,and can occur naturally in arid regions,especially in mineral deposits (evaporites) formed when seasonal lakes evaporate.Deposits of the mineral natron have been mined from dry lake bottoms in Egypt since ancient times,when natron was used in the preparation of mummies and in the early manufacture of glass.Sodium carbonate can be manufactured by Solvay's …Solvay’s process is not used for preparation of K2CO3,Cs2CO3,Rb2CO3 because of higher water solubility of their bicarbonates which makes it difficult to separate them from NH4Cl.Solubility order=Li2CO3&lt;Na2CO3&lt;K2CO3&lt;Rb2CO3&lt;Cr2CO3 This is seen
