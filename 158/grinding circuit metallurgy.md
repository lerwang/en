## DESIGN AND OPERATION OF VERTIMILL® FOR SECONDARY GRINDING
A silver lead zinc mine in Queensland,Australia was originally designed to treat 15 million wet metric tonnes per annum The original grinding circuit consisted only of primary autogenous millingGrinding Mineral Technologies GroupThe grinding media in a Rod mill are long rods of particular material which grind the ore by tumbling within the mill The grinding action is by line contact between the long rods There is a very minimal slime production since rods tumble and spin in roughly parallel alignment and produce size reduction of coarse ores efficiently

## Comminution Wikipedia
Comminution is the reduction of solid materials from one average particle size to a smaller average particle size,by crushing,grinding,cutting,vibrating,or other process In geology,it occurs naturally during faulting in the upper part of the Earth's crustFine Grinding Circuit Process Improvement at the Karara,Fine Grinding Circuit Process Improvement at the Karara Mine Concentrator,to 35 &#181;m with a steeper size distribution could be achieved by using the bottom feed configuration with additional grinding power The TowerMill circuit was converted to bottom feed configuration and the performance was evaluated, MAusIMM,Metallurgy Manager.
