2020 2 24&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Flotation Frothers What is the Function of Frothers.The function of frothers in flotation is that of building the froth which serves as the buoyant medium in the separation of the floatable from the non floatable minerals.Frothers accomplish this by lowering the surface tension of the liquid which in turn permits air rising through the pulp to accumulate at the surface in bubble form.Productive froth flotation technology FLSmidthA flotation circuit’s performance is affected by both pulp and froth phase recovery.And it is inherent in mining operations that manual control by operators who look at the cell surface periodically and then take action does not really maintain stable operating conditions.

## Froth Flotation and Gold Extraction
Because of the surfactant,the gold is repelled by the water into the air bubbles,which rise to the top creating a bubbly gold foam.The froth is removed from the top of the cell creating concentrated gold,while the flotation tailings at the bottom of the tank are1 Froth Flotation Fundamental Principles2009 8 27&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;1 Froth Flotation Fundamental Principles Froth flotation is a highly versatile method for physically separating particles based on differences in the ability of air bubbles to selectively adhere to specific mineral surfaces in a mineral water slurry.The particles with attached air bubbles are then carried to the surface and
