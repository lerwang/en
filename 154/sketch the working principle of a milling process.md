## The working principle of ball mill
The ball mill consists of a metal cylinder and a ball.The working principle is that when the cylinder is rotated,the grinding body (ball) and the object to be polished (material) installed in the cylinder are rotated by the cylinder under the action of friction and centrifugal.WORKING PRINCIPLE AND TYPES OF MILLING MACHINEToday we will focus on milling operation,where we will see here the basic of milling process,Principle of milling operation,up milling versus down milling and finally we will see the classification of milling machines.So let us start to discuss first the basic of.
