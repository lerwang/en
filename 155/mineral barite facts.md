## Get to Know the 7 Delie Sulfate Minerals ThoughtCo
Sulfate minerals are delie and occur near the Earth's surface in sedimentary rocks such as limestone,gypsum rock,and rock salt.Sulfates tend to live near oxygen and water.There is a whole community of bacteria that make their living by reducing sulfate to sulfide where oxygen is absent.Gypsum is by far the most common sulfate mineral.Mineral Resource of the Month: Barite EARTH MagazineThe mineral barite (barium sulfate),also known as barytes,is most commonly found in hydrothermal veins and as veins in limestone.It is very dense (it has a high specific gravity) and is relatively soft.Those properties make it an excellent weighting agent in drilling muds for petroleum wells.In fact,worldwide,oil and gas drilling account for 85 to 90 percent of barite consumption.

## Barite Facts
Barite is a non metallic mineral composed of barium sulfate.The name barite comes from the Greek word &quot;barys&quot; which means heavy due to its high specific gravity of 4.5.Though exceptional for a nonmetallic mineral,the high specific gravity allows it to be suitable.Barite Mineral and Healing PropertiesInteresting Facts.Barite is an important commercial mineral.Barite mud is poured into deep oil wells.The heavy mud helps to flush rock chips away from the drilling head and float them to the surface for inspection.The heavy mud also partially supports the enormous weight of the steel drilling tools.
