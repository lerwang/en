## circulating load in ball mill
circulating load in ball mill,The circulating loads generated in a typical ball mill cyclone circuit contain a small fraction of bypassed fines The concept that high circulating loads will result in overgrinding can be refuted by regarding increases in circulating load in the same vein as multistage grindingDisturbance observer based multi variable control of …In this paper,a disturbance observer based multi variable control (DOMC) strategy has been developed to control the ball mill grinding circuits (MIMO systems) with such external and internal disturbances.The control strategy consists of two compound controllers for the two loops,respectively.
