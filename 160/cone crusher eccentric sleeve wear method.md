## Cone Crushers for Sale
Cone Crushers The cone crusher was designed primarily with a view to achieving top performance in the field of fine reduction crushing It has also been adapted to what is designated simply as fine crushing which extends into a range below that ordinarily defined by the term fine reduction Although the eccentric speeds of the various sizes of this type are not quite so high asCone Crushers McLanahanCone Crushers.A Cone Crusher is a compression type of machine that reduces material by squeezing or compressing the feed material between a moving piece of steel and a stationary piece of steel.Final sizing and reduction is determined by the closed side setting or the gap between the two

The cone crusher works in this way: the motor drives the eccentric sleeve through the horizontal shaft and a pair of bevel gears.The sleeve rotates and the main shaft is forced by this rotation to do the pendulum motion,making the mantle approach and get away from the concave repeatedly,so that the ores are squeezed,bent,and crushed.Cone Crusher Wear PartsCone crusher is mainly composed of frame,transmission shaft,eccentric sleeve,spherical bearing,cone crusher,adjusting device,adjusting sleeve,spring and blanking port.Each part plays an important role in the operation of the machine,but there are four parts that are the most important equipment of the machine.
