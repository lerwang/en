## Ball Mills vs Rod Mills
When the mill is rotated without feed or with very fine feed,the rods are in parallel alignment and in contact with one another for their full length.New feed entering at one end of the mill causes the rod charge to spread at that end.This produces a series of wedge shaped slots tapering toward the discharge end.The tumbling and rolling rods expend most of their crushing force on the.SAG MillThe SAG Mill is a machine added by Ender IO.It uses Redstone Flux (RF) to grind (or mill) items into their crushed variants,like Ores into Dusts.The SAG Mill has four output slots; recipes can have 1 4 different outputs,with different chances of ob
