## Illinois Windmills History of Wind Power
What has made wind power historically troublesome is its unpredictability.Winds that can gently push fallen leaves on a sunny fall afternoon can also just as easily tear off a roof in a destructive storm.Despite this,technology has allowed mills to adapt to changing wind conditions to keep our machines moving.How Do Grain Windmills Work? SciencingSince ancient times,windmills have been used,primarily as a method of grinding grain into flour by using the power of the wind.The original windmills,used in Persia in the 9th century,were vertical axis mills,but modern windmills use a horizontal axis,in which the blades are fixed to a central post,which is.

Sciencing&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Energy in wind comes from the uneven solar heating of the atmosphere.The use of wind for energy goes back to the earliest sailing ships.On land,windmills applied the principle of sails to a rotary shaft,to harvest the mechanical energy of wind for providing mechanical power.Small windmills on farms power water.

## The Basics of Wind Energy AWEA
When the wind blows past a wind turbine,its blades capture the wind’s kinetic energy and rotate,turning it into mechanical energy.This rotation turns an internal shaft connected to a gearbox,which increases the speed of rotation by a factor of 100.That spins a generator that produces electricity.wind shaftThe winding shaft (11) is used to wind up the cover (10),which cover is guided over a deflection device (14) to an outlet opening (35) of the device space (3) and,at the end facing the winding shaft (11),is connected to an outer tractive element (12),which is seated against the side of the cover (10) facing away from t
