## Basalt Geogrids,Basalt Meshes,and Basalt Chopped fibers,
Asphalt road overlays suffer from serious cracking under heavy traffic Basalt fibers will extend the life of asphalt or concrete pavement while allowing for less material! So if a half an inch less asphalt can be applied while having a 30 50 percent better lifespan,it is a no brainer! For concrete,Why are they Replacing All the Concrete Roads with Asphalt,More over,during this service life concrete road do not require frequent repair or patching work like asphalt roads Vehicles consume less fuel: A vehicle,when run over a concrete road,consumes 15 20% less fuel than that on asphalt roads This is because of the fact that a concrete road does not get deflected under the wheels of loaded trucks
