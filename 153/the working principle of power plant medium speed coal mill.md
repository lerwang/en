## Power Plants and Types of Power Plant Electrical4U
The energy source harnessed to turn the generator shaft varies widely,and is chiefly dependent on the type of fuel used.Types of Power Station A power plant can be of several types depending mainly on the type of fuel used.Since for the purpose of bulk power generation,only thermal,nuclear and hydro power comes handy,therefore a power generating station can be broadly classified in the 3.Ball Mill Critical Speed &amp; Working Principle&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;If 75 percent of critical speed is considered desirable for efficient grinding in a 2.4 meter (8 foot) diameter mill,then the same will be true for a 5.0 meter (15&#189; foot) diameter mill.
