## Physical and Chemical Properties of Soil
Average density of soil in bulk is 1 5 gm ml.Organic soils have low bulk density as compared to mineral soils.Soil weight varies in relation to textural classes.Average weight of loam or sandy soil is 80—110 pounds cubic foot but that of clay ranges between 70 and 100 pounds cubic foot.
