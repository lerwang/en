## Sediment
Sediment is a naturally occurring material that is broken down by processes of weathering and erosion,and is subsequently transported by the action of wind,water,or ice,and or by the force of gravity acting on the particles.For example,silt falls out of suspension via sedimentation and forms soil (some of which may eventually become sedimentary rock).Sediment Grain Size Chart for RocksThe grain sizes of sediments and sedimentary rocks are a matter of great interest to geologists.Different size sediment grains form different types of rocks and can reveal information about the landform and environment of an area from millions of years prior.

## Particle size (grain size) : Wikis (The Full Wiki)
Particle size or grain size refers to the diameter of a grain of granular material,such as sediment or the lithified particles in clastic rock.(The diameter of an irregular volume is the longest distance between two points on its surface.) Granular material can range from very small colloidal particles,through clay,silt,sand,and gravel,to boulders.Grain sizeGrain size (or particle size) is the diameter of individual grains of sediment,or the lithified particles in clastic rocks.The term may also be applied to other granular materials.This is different from the crystallite size,which refers to the size of a single crystal inside a particle or grain.inside a particle or grain.

## How River Rocks Round: Resolving the Shape Size Paradox
River bed sediments display two universal downstream trends: fining,in which particle size decreases; and rounding,where pebble shapes evolve toward ellipsoids.Rounding is known to result from transport induced abrasion; however many researchers argue that the contribution of abrasion to downstream fining is negligible.This presents a paradox: downstream shape change indicates substantial.rock quary equipmentsrock crusher for sell 64 mm = inches rock particle size cobble antique mini rock crusher for sale rock crusher made in the usa rock removal claw equipment africa rock quarry project ayosdito small jaw rock crusher cubic meter per capacity large portable rock
