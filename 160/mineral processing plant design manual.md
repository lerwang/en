## Crushing Plant Design and Layout Considerations
24&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Crushing Plant Design and Layout Considerations Ken Boyd,Manager,Material Handling,AMEC Mining &amp; Metals,Vancouver,BC ABSTRACT In mining operations,the layout of crushing plants and ancillary equipment and structures is a crucial factor in meeting production requirements while keeping capital and operational costs to a minimum.The process design of gold leaching and carbon in pulp.27&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;plant and or full scale plant.In the case of leaching and CIP CIL,such data are relatively easy to obtain for existing plants,assuming that the problem is one of the design of an upgrade for an existing plant.In the case of a new plant,such data are much more difficult to come by,particularly if the ore is from a deep underground mine.
