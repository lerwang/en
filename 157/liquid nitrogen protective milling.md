## Use Nitrogen Safely
Use Nitrogen Safely p Figure 1.Gaseous nitrogen,vaporized from onsite liquid storage into a local distribution system,is used for a wide variety of applications,including blanketing,inerting,purging,stripping,and sparging.Other supply modes ranging fromLiquid nitrogenLiquid nitrogen is nitrogen in a liquid state at an extremely low temperature.It is a colorless liquid with a density of 0.807 g ml at its boiling point (−195.79 C (77 K; −320 F)) and a dielectric constant of 1.43.It is also referred to as dry ice or LN2.Liquid nitrogen is a cryogenic liquid that can cause rapid freezing on contact with living tissue.

## Cryogenic grinding
Cryogenic grinding,also known as freezer milling,freezer grinding,and cryomilling,is the act of cooling or chilling a material and then reducing it into a small particle size.For example,thermoplastics are difficult to grind to small particle sizes at ambient temperatures because they soften,adhere in lumpy masses and clog screens.When.Liquid Nitrogen Environmental Health &amp; SafetyLiquid nitrogen is inert,colorless,odorless,non corrosive,nonflammable,and extremely cold.Nitrogen makes up the major portion of the atmosphere (78% by volume).Nitrogen is inert and will not support combustion; however,it is not life supporting.When nitrogen is converted to liquid form it becomes a cryogenic liquid.Cryogenic liquids are liquefied gases that
