## Direct Reduced Iron Open Source Ecology
Direct reduced iron (DRI) is a metallic material formed by the reduction (removal of oxygen) of iron oxide (iron ore) at temperatures below the melting point of iron.DRI is produced by the use of a reducing gas (mostly a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide).The temperatures for this process are significantly lower than those in a blast furnace,and capital requirements are also lower.Efficiency of hydrogen utilization in reduction…28 Apr 2013 Reducing hydrogen is gained from natural or coke gas,during which in the blast furnace but also in the area of direct iron production from ores.technological innovations of iron production,especially using new kinds of

## Direct Reduced Iron (DRI) International Iron Metallics.
Natural gas consists primarily of methane (CH 4),together with small amounts of other hydrocarbons,nitrogen,and carbon dioxide.Natural gas cannot be used directly in the reduction of iron ore because it decomposes to form soot at a temperature below that which iron oxide can be reduced.
