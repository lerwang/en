## Sieve analysis of coarse and fine aggregate Report
We conclude that sieve analysis is the simple and easy way to determine the particle size distribution of aggregate and this sieve analysis procedure can be used by people who are working in the laboratory like government laboratory and private independent laboratoryAggregatesFine Aggregate The other type of aggregates are those particles passing the 9.5 mm (3 8 in.) sieve,almost entirely passing the 4.75 mm (No.4) sieve,and predominantly retained on the 75 &#181;m (No.200) sieve are called fine aggregate.For increased workability and for economy as reflected by use of less cement,the fine aggregate should have a rounded shape.
