## Iron ore
Increasing iron ore demand,coupled with the depletion of high grade hematite ores in the United States,after World War II led to development of lower grade iron ore sources,principally the utilization of magnetite and taconite.Iron ore mining methods vary by theALTERNATIVE BINDERS TO BENTONITE FOR IRON ORE,provide a blast furnace feed product with Fe grade of about 65% (Ball et al,1973) In pelletizing,iron ore,water and a binder are balled in a mechanical disc or drum to produce wet pellets Bentonite is the most widely used binder in iron ore pelletizing industry The use of

## SeqiOlivine Improves the Sintering and Pelletizing,
In the BF slag the magnesia can increase the fluidity range,reduce alkali recirculation (by formation of stable magnesium alkali silicates),and it may also make the slag less sensitive to other chemical impurities and or temperature variations Iron ore pelletizing with generic olivine as an additive may reduce swelling,provide a narrow melting range and accelerate the reduction3 Another.Use of Boron Compounds as Binders in Iron Ore Pelletization1 IRON ORE PELLETIZING The main raw material in iron steel industry is iron ore Iron ores can be classified as high grade and low grade in terms of their Fe content High grade iron ores which can be used directly in the blast furnace to produce metallic iron are not abundant in earth’s crust to supply the need of iron steel industry

## Iron Ore Pellets and Pelletization Process IspatGuru
Iron Ore Pellets and Pelletization Process Pelletizing of iron ore was started in the 1950s to facilitate the utilization of finely ground iron ore concentrates in steel production.For the pelletizing of iron ore there are two main types of processes namely,the straightBlast Furnace Slag National Slag AssociationBlast Furnace Slag is formed when iron ore or iron pellets,coke and a flux (either limestone or dolomite) are melted together in a blast furnace.When the metallurgical smelting process is complete,the lime in the flux has been chemically combined with the.
