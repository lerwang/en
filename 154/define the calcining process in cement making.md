## Cement kiln
Cement kilns are used for the pyroprocessing stage of manufacture of Portland and other types of hydraulic cement,in which calcium carbonate reacts with silica bearing minerals to form a mixture of calcium silicates.Over a billion tonnes of cement are made per year,and cement kilns are the heart of this production process: their capacity.cement Definition,Composition,Manufacture,History,&amp; …Cement,in general,adhesive substances of all kinds,but,in a narrower sense,the binding materials used in building and civil engineering construction.Cements of this kind are finely ground powders that,when mixed with water,set to a hard mass.Learn more about cement in this article.

## Cement clinker
Cement clinker is a solid material produced in the manufacture of Portland cement as an intermediary product.Clinker occurs as lumps or nodules,usually 3 millimetres (0.12 in) to 25 millimetres (0.98 in) in diameter.It is produced by sintering (fusing together without melting to the point of liquefaction) limestone and aluminosilicate materials such as clay during the cement kiln stage.CalcinationProcesses description calcination To calcine mineral ores means to change the chemical composition by a thermal process or to drive off a volatile fraction.Compared to pyrolysis the absence of oxygen is not necessary in this process.Directly heated as well as
