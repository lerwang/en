## Copper Mining and Processing: Processing of Copper …
Copper processing is a complicated process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper called cathodes,which will ultimately be made into products for everyday use.The most common types of ore,copper oxide and copper sulfide,undergo two different processes,hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy,respectively,due to the different.Gold ore Old School RuneScape Wiki Fandom2020 3 3&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Gold ore can be mined at level 40 Mining providing 65 Mining experience.After a gold rock is mined,it will take 60 seconds until it reappears.Gold ore is the raw material used to smelt a gold bar.Smelting gold ore into a bar gives 22.5 Smithing experience,or 56.2 with the goldsmith.
